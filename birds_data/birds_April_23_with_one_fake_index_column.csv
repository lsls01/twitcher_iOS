Columbiformes Order – Columbidae family
INTRODUCTION: 
    This  large Columbidae is endemic to New Zealand where it is also known as Kereru,  and Kukupa in Northland. 
    This  arboreal species feeds mainly on fruit and flowers, and may fly long distances  to find its preferred food items. 
    The New  Zealand Pigeon is protected, but it is still hunted illegally in some forests,  and it is a good prey for the introduced mammalian predators.
    The  Chatham Island Pigeon is usually considered a separate species and will be  studied later.
    The Norfolk  Island Pigeon (H.n. spadicea) is extinct due to hunting and predation.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  50-51 cm
    Weight: 630-650  g
The  adult is a heavily built bird with iridescent metallic green upperparts. Nape,  mantle, scapulars and lesser wing-coverts show purple and bronze reflections.  Back and rump are duller, with pale silvery grey tinge on rump,  uppertail-coverts and bases of primaries, often conspicuous in flight. The tail  is blackish-brown with indistinct paler tip. There is a narrow white band  between the breast and the folded wing.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 4 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334229

Procellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is included in the subfamily Oceanitinae in the family  Hydrobatidae. It is the only member of the genus Garrodia. This species occurs  in Southern Ocean. It differs from other storm-petrels by the grey back and  inner part of the wing, and the pale grey rump instead of white. 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is vulnerable on land, and predation by the Brown Skua is a major threat at breeding colonies. It is mainly  solitary, although sometimes seen in small groups. They nest in loose colonies. 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is the smallest storm-petrel in the New Zealand region, but this  sparrow-sized bird has very powerful flight in full force gales in New Zealand subantarctic  waters.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  16-19 cm
    Wingspan:  39-40 cm
    Weight:  35 g (21-44 g)
The adult  has blackish-grey head, throat, neck and upper breast, whereas mantle, back and  wings are dark grey. On the upperwing, two pale wingbars are formed by the pale  grey tips of both median and greater coverts. Rump and uppertail-coverts are  pale grey to silvery grey. The rectrices are darker grey at base, and mostly blackish-grey  at tip, forming a dark terminal band. 
    In fresh  plumage, the upperparts have scaly appearance due to the pale-tipped feathers. 
    The underparts  are white and contrast strongly with the dark hood. On the underwing, the  trailing edge is dark grey and the leading edge is dark and broader. The flanks  may sometimes show grey streaks while some grey bars are visible on the  undertail-coverts. 
    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are grey-black. 
    Male and  female have similar appearance, although female is usually larger overall. 
    The juvenile  is similar to adults.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel occurs throughout the Southern Ocean and breeds on  several subantarctic islands. As it prefers cold waters, it is a true  subantarctic breeder.
    The genus  Fregetta includes two main species, but actually, there are six distinct forms.  They belong to the Southern Subfamily Oceanitinae that shows great taxonomy diversity. 
    This species  is threatened by invasive and introduced predators to their breeding islands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  20 cm
    Wingspan:  43-46 cm
    Weight:  43-63 g
The adult  has rather compact body with rounded wings and short, square-tipped tail.
    Head,  neck, breast and upperparts including wings and tail, are blackish-brown, whereas  rump and belly are white. Black vent and central belly stripe are variable. This  stripe connects the blackish throat and breast to vent and undertail-coverts. On  the underwing, flight feathers and leading edge are blackish, whereas the  underwing-coverts are white in the centre of the wing. On the upperwing, the  coverts are browner than the blackish flight feathers. We can see some pale  fringes to scapulars and tips of greater coverts, forming an indistinct panel  even in fresh plumage. The undertail is blackish. 
The bill  is black and hooked at tip. The long, tubular, external nostrils might allow  the bird to detect food by smell. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet  are black. 
Both adults  are similar although the female has slightly larger wings, tail and tarsus. 
    The juvenile  resembles adult.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    With a  wingspan of 350 cm, the Wandering Albatross has the largest wings of any living  bird. Its weight ranges from 6300 to 11300 grams, and the immature can be  larger while performing its first flight, as it still has fat reserves. This large  size is more impressive when the bird is gliding easily above the waves. 
    Its other  English names are Snowy Albatross and White-winged Albatross.

The adult  has snowy white plumage overall, except on the black-and-white wings. It  becomes whiter with the age. Mantle and scapulars are white with very narrow blackish  vermiculations extending to the upperwing-coverts.
    The underparts  are entirely white, but the underwing shows black tip and trailing edge. 
    There are  variations, and some birds may have brownish-grey crown, whereas others have  washed pale pink or pale orange ear-coverts. 
    The hooked  bill is pink with pale yellowish tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed  feet are pale grey.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION: 
    The  Northern Royal Albatross was formerly a subspecies of the Royal Albatross (D. epomophora),  but since 1998, it is a full species. 
    The  scientific name “sanfordi” pays tribute to Leonard Cutler Sanford (1868-1950),  ornithologist and trustee of the American Museum of Natural History. 
    The  local Maori’s name is “Toroa”.

The  adult has white body plumage including the upperparts. However, the upperwing  is black, whereas the underwing is white, except the black leading edge from  the carpal joint to the wingtip. The tail is white, and can be sometimes  black-tipped.   
The head  is white, although some females may have black-speckled crown.
    The  hooked bill is pale pink. The upper mandible shows a black cutting edge. The  eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pale pink to flesh. 
    During  the nesting period, bill and tarsi are darker pink.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiforme Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    Although  the Laysan Albatross is a species of the Northern Hemisphere, its breeding  habits are those of a bird of the Southern hemisphere. Actually, it breeds  during the local winter which corresponds to the austral summer, suggesting  that this species originated in the S Hemisphere. It has probably spread northwards  centuries ago, into the Northern Pacific where it is now resident.  
    Albatrosses  are long-lived birds, and the Laysan Albatross may reach 40 years and more.

The  adult has blackish-grey upperparts whereas head, lower rump and underparts are  white. The underwing pattern may vary between birds which show narrow black  margins and variable amounts of black on the underwing-coverts. 
    On the  white head, a grey patch extends from chin to cheeks and ear-coverts. It can be  sometimes indistinct from distance, except around the eye where the colour  becomes almost black. 
    The  typical bill is pink with grey tip on both mandibles, and the upper one has  hooked tip. The eyes are dark brown, with pale grey eyering, mostly white  below. Legs and webbed feet are pale pinkish-grey.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    Formerly,  two subspecies were included under the same name, with the nominate T.m.  melanophris, and the other race T.m. impavida. They are now considered as  separate species under the names Black-browed Albatross and Campbell Albatross,  from recent genetic studies of DNA. However, some disagreement is continuing,  suggesting that genetic divergences between the two subspecies are not  sufficient to separate them. 
(The Campbell Albatross is mentioned here in  the subspecies, but it will be studied later as full species.)

INTRODUCTION:
    The Grey-headed  Albatross breeds on several sub Antarctic islands, with the main populations on  South Georgia, Campbell and Macquarie Islands. This species is threatened by  long-lines fishing which kills a significant proportion of populations. 
    The breeding  adults are known for their long-distance flights in search of food for their  chicks. The maximum foraging ranges have been recorded to be 500-800/1850 km  from their nest. They are graceful and powerful fliers.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Sooty  Albatross is included in the genus Phoebetria alongside the Light-mantled Albatross (P. palpebrata).  Both birds have dark plumage and look very similar. However, they differ in  courtship displays and timing of breeding. Both differ from genus Diomedea in  having more pointed and narrower wings, longer wedge-shaped tail and peculiar  head pattern.

The adult  has entirely sooty-brown plumage with browner head and neck and very dark face.  Belly, wings and tail are variably darker whereas neck and body are slightly paler. 
    In worn  plumage, hindneck to mantle can be much paler and contrast with the head. On the  wings, the white shafts of the outer primaries are conspicuous, and can be seen  even at distance. 
The bill  is black and shows yellowish-pink stripe on the sides of the lower mandible,  but this stripe does not reach the bill tip. The eyes are dark grey to dark  brown, surrounded by broad, white eyering, becoming narrower and broken on  lores. Legs and webbed feet are pale pinkish to bluish-grey.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Antarctic  Petrel is included in the “fulmar-petrel” group in the family Procellariidae. This  species is distinct enough to be placed in the separate, monotypic genus  Thalassoica.
    It is an  agile flier and is very active on the water. It appears less clumsy on land  than most other petrels. It rarely wanders far from pack ice and icebergs. It breeds  in dense colonies and its population is large and currently stable.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Blue  Petrel is the sole member of genus Halobaena. Its plumage pattern is very  similar to that of prions of genus Pachyptila, but it differs from prions in  some ecological aspects and morphological features. 
    The Blue  Petrel is found in Antarctic and subantarctic waters. Its global population  appears to be stable. The main threat is the predation by rats and cats on some  breeding islands. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  26-32 cm
    Wingspan:  58-71 cm
    Weight:  150-250 g
The adult  has grey-blue upperparts with conspicuous blackish M across the upperwing, well  visible in flight. The three outermost primaries are blacker. The rearmost  scapulars and the tertials are dark grey with white tips. The tail is grey-blue  with dark indistinct subterminal band and broad white tip, slightly narrower on  the outermost rectrices. 
    The underparts,  including wings and tail, are white. 
On the  head, a blackish cap extends to and around the eye and onto the neck sides,  forming a dark partial or sometimes complete collar. It contrasts strongly with  the white forehead and throat. 
    The bill  is blackish-grey to bluish-black. The eyes are blackish-brown. Legs and webbed  feet are blue-grey with pink webs. 
Male and  female have similar plumage, but the female is smaller with shorter wings. 
    The juvenile  is browner on the upperparts, and it has greyer forehead.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew  Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Fairy  Prion is the smallest species of the genus Pachyptila and shows the  characteristic blackish M on the upperwings. 
    It is  found in the Southern Ocean. It breeds in colonies and nests in burrows or rock  crevices, usually on small islands. 
    The name  of this species comes from its most typical call, a faint coo fairly similar to  that of some doves.

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Westland  Petrel is one of the few petrels still breeding on New Zealand mainland. Although  being the largest burrowing petrel, this species is vulnerable to introduced  dogs and cats, and also stoats and rats, whereas pigs destroy the nesting burrows. 
    The Westland  Petrel suffered heavy degradation of the habitat due to human activities. However,  it inhabits much of the same breeding range as it did formerly, prior to human  habitations. This species is endemic to New Zealand.

The adult  has sooty-black plumage overall, including head and neck which are often  darker. However, a few birds may have some odd white feathers. 
    On the  underwing, the bases of primaries and coverts are greyer and slightly paler. 
    The bill  is ivory to pale yellowish, with blackish culmen and tips of both mandibles. The  eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are blackish. 
    Male and  female have similar appearance.

Procallariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The first  illustration of the Black Petrel was made by Sydney Parkinson during the James  Cook’s first trip to the Pacific in 1768. This species was first seen off the  New Zealand coasts. French, English and scientific names pay tribute to this  artist. 
    This petrel  is the smallest species of genus Procellaria. Often solitary at sea, it may  feed in small groups associated with marine mammals.  
    The small  population appears currently stable, but the species has restricted breeding  range and is threatened by the usual introduced predators. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:

The adult  has sooty-black plumage with slightly darker head and neck. 
    On the  underwing, coverts and bases of primary flight feathers are paler and greyer. 
    The bill  is pale yellowish with greyer culmen and tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and  webbed feet are blackish. 
Both sexes  are similar, although the male has slightly larger wings and bill than female. 
    The juvenile  resembles adults with less yellowish bill, mostly tinged greyish, bluish or  pink.
The  Black Petrel is smaller and more slender than the White-chinned Petrel (P. aequinoctialis), and very similar to the Westland Petrel (P. westlandica),  although the Black Petrel has slightly smaller bill and narrower wings.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Grey  Petrel has circumpolar distribution and occurs on several subantarctic islands  during the breeding season. Like other petrels, it breeds in colonies and nests  in burrows. It is marine and pelagic, and returns to islands only for breeding. 
    It forages  in the open sea by diving, and can reach depths of 10 metres. It uses its wings  for swimming underwater. It is attracted by fishing boats where it is  threatened by baited fish hooks. 
    Mammal predators  on breeding islands are responsible for declines, and this species is currently  listed as Near Threatened.

The adult  is a heavy-bodied seabird with narrow, long wings and ashy-grey plumage above  and white below. 
    The head  is dark grey to brownish-grey, but nape and upperparts are paler, slightly  darker on the upperwing, and even more on the tail. The upperparts show  slightly scaled pattern at close range.
    On the  underparts, the underwing is dark grey to brownish-grey, including the  axillaries. The wedge-shaped tail is grey. Rest of underparts is whitish, but  thighs and undertail-coverts may show some brownish-grey tinge. 
The head  may appear hooded sometimes, according to the distance and the light. 
    The stout  bill varies from greenish to yellowish or grey, but it is mostly ivory with blackish  culmen. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are fleshy-grey, darker  outside and with yellowish webs. 
Male and  female have similar plumage, but the male is slightly larger overall.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Little  Shearwater is the smallest species of all shearwaters with a length of 28  centimetres. Formerly, this species had several subspecies spread over the wide  range, but now, only five subspecies are recognized. 
    It is fairly  sedentary and more aquatic in its feeding behaviour, involving short, broad wings  and stocky body. 
    The Little  Shearwater is threatened by introduced mammal predators on the breeding grounds,  but today, several islands are predator-free. Degradation of the habitat and human  disturbance, with in addition erosion of sand dunes that destroy the nesting  burrows, make the species at risk in some parts of the range. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:
    Length:  28 cm (25-30 cm)
    Wingspan:  58-67 cm
    Weight:  140-275 g
The adult  of nominate race has dark, almost black upperparts, including head, upperwing  and tail. The hindneck may appear paler. 
    The underparts  are white but we can see a narrow black margin on the underwing. The white of  the underparts extends upwards to the sides of the rump. 
    On the  head, face and narrow supercilium are white, whereas the eye’s area shows dark  spotting in front of the eye and on the upper ear-coverts. The sides of lower  neck and upper breast are dark grey with some white flecking. 
    The bill  is blackish with blue-grey base. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet  are bluish with some blackish on the outer side of the tarsus and outer toe,  and mostly pinkish webs. 
    Male and  female are similar, but the female has shorter tail. 
    The juvenile  resembles adults.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It breeds on several  subantarctic islands including Gough, Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet and  Kerguelen Islands, and probably Tristan da Cunha. 
HABITAT: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds in colonies established near the sea on flat or gently sloped  tundra, or on slopes covered with tussock grass. It nests in self-excavated  burrow. 
    Outside the  breeding season, it is marine and pelagic, and occurs mainly in cold waters. 
CALLS AND SONGS: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel is usually silent at sea where it is often solitary. At colonies, this  species is relatively quiet, only giving wheezy “chee-chee-chay” while flying  over the burrows. Some higher-pitched, more drawn-our sounds can be heard too.
BEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel feeds mainly on squid (Gonatus antarcticus), some fish and crustaceans,  especially krill of genus Euphausia, and cephalopods. 
    Squid is  caught at night by surface-seizing, but it also performs dipping and surface-plunging.  It may associate with cetaceans that lead the preys close to the surface.
It is  usually solitary at sea, but it may take part to exuberant chases if numerous seabirds  are present. However, small groups of 4-5 birds congregate at food sources. It shows  little interest in ships. 
    When feeding  in open waters around Antarctica, it can be seen with Cape Petrel, Blue Petrel and Antarctic Prion.   
The Kerguelen  Petrel is nocturnal at colonies, although it may sometimes visit them by day. They  are monogamous. They breed in colonies and only defend the burrow. The laying occurs  in October, after a pre-laying exodus of four weeks in September. 
The Kerguelen  Petrel adults may visit the colonies all year round. They frequent subantarctic  and Antarctic waters S to pack ice throughout the year. 
    It disperses  widely S through Southern Ocean N to 40°S, sometimes to South Africa, Australia  and New Zealand. It may occasionally disperse as far as the Falklands and South  Georgia. 
The Kerguelen  Petrel performs a spectacular fast flight in strong winds, often in high  sweeping arcs and long glides. It may hover in Falco-like fashion at 20-30  metres above the water. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
    The breeding  season takes place between August and January/February, with the egg-laying in  October.   
    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds colonially on tussock-covered slopes with soft, wet soil in which  it digs the long burrow (0,80-2,80 metres) lined with vegetation. The entrance is  sheltered by tussock grass from strong winds. 
The female  lays a single white egg. The incubation lasts 46-51 days, shared by both adults  in long stints of 10-15 days. 
    At hatching,  the chick is covered with sooty-brown down. It is brooded for the first two  days. Both parents feed it and it fledges about 59-62 days after hatching. 
    This species  produces a single brood per season.
PROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel has wide range in which it is abundant. There is extensive predation by  rats and cats in Crozet Islands, whereas skuas and dogs take some birds at Gough and Tristan da Cunha.
    The global  population was estimated at about 1,000,000 individuals in 2004, and appears to  be stable.
    The Kerguelen  Petrel is currently evaluated as Least Concern.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew  Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The  White-headed Petrel is a member of Pterodroma genus which includes the seabirds  known as “gadfly petrels”. This name is related to the high soaring flight at  sea performed by these birds. 
    This  species has distant feeding grounds and this flight allow it to travel long  distances from land. It is strictly nocturnal when breeding, in order to avoid  predation by the Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus).

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Great-winged  Petrel is now a monotypic species, but it was recently still treated as  conspecific with P. gouldi (Grey-faced Petrel). 
    This dark  petrel is highly pelagic and comes ashore only for breeding. It breeds on  subantarctic and Antarctic islands where it nests in burrows. 
    This species  is affected by illegal harvesting at colonies, and by mammalian predators  introduced to the islands, although several breeding islands are today  predator-free.

The Great-winged  Petrel adult is fairly large. It has dark plumage overall, mostly sooty brown  with variable paler and greyer area at base of bill.
    The underwing  appears uniformly dark, but according to the light, the greater coverts are  paler and greyer, and a slightly silvery patch is visible at base of primaries. 
    The wings  are long and pointed. The tail is wedge-shaped. 
On the  dark head, the bill is black with hooked tip. The eyes are blackish-brown. Legs  and webbed feet are black. 
Male and  female are similar.
    The juvenile  has a pale grey area around the bill and mostly black plumage at fledging.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The diving-petrel’s  taxonomy is still a matter of some debate, and depending on the authors, these  birds can be placed in the family Procellariidae or in the family Pelecanoididae  (like on this page). There are four species of small, stocky seabirds highly  adapted to the aquatic life. 
    The Common  Diving-Petrel has the widest range, but it is threatened by introduced and  invasive species on the breeding islands where it nests in burrows.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:

    Wingspan:  33-38 cm
    Weight:  86-185 g
The adult  is very similar to the Little Auk or  Dovekie (Alle alle) of the Northern Hemisphere. But there is any relation  between the two families. 
    The upperparts,  including upperwing and uppertail, are grey-black. The short, rounded wings are  browner, especially on primaries. In fresh plumage, the rectrices have whitish  tips. 
  The underparts  are dusky white with grey underwing, mostly dark grey on axillaries and  marginal coverts. The undertail is grey. There are some grey spots on body  sides and rear flanks. 
On the  head, we can see a blackish-grey mask through the eyes and on anterior  ear-coverts. Supercilium and neck-sides are dull white. There is a large grey  to dark grey patch on breast-sides, sometimes forming a complete collar.   
The short,  broad-based, hooked bill is blackish-grey, but the lower mandible has paler  base and pale horn spot at centre. It is formed by several horny plates. The two  external tubular nostrils are open upwards (forwards in other petrels) as an  adaptation for diving. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pale  blue with blackish webs and soles.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Emperor Penguin is the largest species of this family. It lives in very harsh  environment on the Antarctic ice, and forages in the surrounding cold waters.  This inhospitable habitat involves first physical adaptations, and then  co-operative behaviours, in order to survive, feed and breed in such extreme  conditions.  
    This  amazing bird has beautiful appearance as well as chick as adult. They spend all  the year between Antarctic ice and nearby waters. They are living on frozen  sea-ice where they breed in colonies.

    The name  of the Adelie Penguin pays tribute to Adelie d’Urville, the wife of the French  polar explorer Dumont d’Urville (1790-1842). 
    The Adelie  Penguins are living in the southernmost coldest parts of the range, and this  anomalous distribution could have originated from their peculiar diet. This species  feeds mostly on small krill of order Euphausiacea,  and has been recorded occasionally at depths of 175 metres.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Fiordland  Penguin is endemic to New Zealand and breeds in the coastal rainforest. It is  closely related to the Snares Penguin but some physical and behavioural differences are reported. 
    The Fiordland  Penguin is very shy and mainly active during the night when on land. Outside the  breeding season, it is found in the open ocean and shows solitary lifestyle. 
    This species  has small populations (5000-6000 mature birds) and restricted range, and is  currently listed as Vulnerable.  
    This species  is also known as Fiordland Crested Penguin.

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Erect-crested Penguin is one of the largest penguins of genus Eudyptes. Its  funny appearance with the yellow erect eyebrows makes this species different on  land. However, at sea with wet drooping feathers, it can be easily confused  with Fiordland Penguin and Snares Penguin. 
    It is  also called Sclater’s Penguin, after the English zoologist Philip Lutley  Sclater (1829-1913). 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:

The  adult has blue-black upperparts and white underparts. Flippers are blue-black  too, with white trailing edge. The underside is white with black tip. 
    The head  is much darker, usually black. We can see a broad yellow stripe starting above  the lore and extending over the eye and forming an erect crest. 
    The bill  is brownish-red and fairly long. There is a pinkish-white edge along the lower  mandible and the gape. The eyes are deep red.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Royal  Penguin is very similar to the Macaroni  Penguin (E. chrysolophus). Both species were formerly considered to be the  same species. The Royal Penguin is the largest member of genus Eudyptes. 
    Both scientific  and French names pay tribute to the German zoologist Hermann Schlegel  (1804-1884). 
    Populations  have increased through the 20th century, but this species has very  restricted range on some islands, and is classified as Vulnerable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  70-76 cm

The adult  has blue-black upperparts and flippers, and white underparts. The underside of  flippers is white with black leading edge and tip. Unlike the Macaroni  Penguin, it has white face,  chin and throat.
    On the  head, the crest is orange-yellow and black, and formed by elongated feathers. The  eye area is grey and the ear-coverts are white. 
    The red-orange  bill is large and heavy, with pink gape and yellow wash below the lower  mandible and on lores. The eyes are deep red. Legs and webbed feet are pale  pink with black claws.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION: 
    The  Little Penguin is the smallest species of this family. Unlike most of the other  penguins, this species lives and breeds in burrows or natural holes, and spends  the day out at sea, alone or in small groups. 
    This  species is also named Fairy Penguin, Little Blue Penguin or Blue Penguin, from  its small size and its slate-blue plumage.
    The  Little Penguin has several subspecies, and among them, the White-flippered Penguin  (E.m. albosignata) is sometimes considered a full species. But currently, it is  considered a colour morph or a subspecies of the Little Penguin since 2012.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:

The  adult resembles juveniles of genus Spheniscus, with short, stocky body. It has pale  blue to slate-blue upperparts, depending on the season and the age. 
The  underparts are white, with indistinct transition between upperparts and  underparts, from grey to brown, mainly visible in the face. The flippers are  bluish above and white below. 
The head  is like the upperparts, with slate-grey ear-coverts fading to white below. 
The bill  is dark blackish-grey, and is about 3-4 centimetres long. The eyes are bluish-grey  or pale grey. Legs and webbed feet are pink, with black soles and webbing.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Suliformes Order – Fregatidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Christmas  Frigatebird has small breeding range on Christmas Island, in E Indian Ocean. This  species is listed as Critically Endangered due to low breeding success and long  breeding cycle, small and decreasing population, clearing of rainforest for  phosphate mining, introduced Yellow crazy ants, cats and rats. These are the  main threats which affect this bird. 
    Outside the  breeding season, the Christmas Frigatebird disperses widely at sea, N to near  the Philippines, and is exposed to hunting, entanglement in fishing nets and  marine pollution. 
    This spectacular  large seabird is well-adapted to this robust ecological role, but it may be so  fragile in other traits. Like numerous island bird species, the Christmas Frigatebird  is affected by human presence and its following consequences. Conservation  strategies are needed.

The adult  has black plumage, deeply forked tail and long, hooked bill. 
    The adult  male has blackish-brown plumage overall, with green to bluish-green gloss on  the blacker head, and on neck, mantle and scapulars. On the upperwing, there is  a broad, pale brownish diagonal panel formed by paler secondary coverts. The forked  tail is blackish. 
    On the underparts,  we can see a conspicuous white patch on belly, but it does not reach vent or  axillaries, although some males may show some few white feathers on outer  axillary area. 
The head  is black with red gular pouch becoming inflated during the breeding season, but  much duller and reduced outside breeding.
    The long,  hooked bill is bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown, surrounded by narrow  blackish eyering. Legs and feet are slaty grey.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Macquarie  Shag is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), but it is currently considered  a full species. It is very similar to other blue-eyed cormorants living  throughout the Sub Antarctic islands, but they have well separated ranges. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  71-75 cm
    Wingspan:  110 cm
    Weight:  2500-3500 g
The adult  has black hindneck and upperparts with blue gloss. Scapulars and upperwing show  more bronzy gloss. A white wingbar is formed by several lesser upperwing  secondary coverts. Flight feathers and greater coverts have brownish-silver  sheen. The tail is duller and blackish, with whitish shafts at base. It may  have some hair-like white filoplumes on head and upperparts. 
    The underparts  are white with blackish underwing, although the basal part of the leading edge  is white. The outer side of the thighs is black. 
The head  is black with greenish-blue gloss down to gape. Chin, throat and foreneck are  white. 
    During the  breeding season, there is a black crest on the forecrown, which is much reduced  or lost towards the end of this period. The white filoplumes are lost too, and  the plumage becomes duller. 
    The eyes  are dark greenish-brown, surrounded by blue, bare eyering. We can see  conspicuous yellow caruncles on sides of forehead, and smaller darker yellow caruncles  on the blackish background around the gape, at base of lower mandible.
    The bill  is blackish with horn-coloured tip. Legs and webbed feet are pink. 
    Outside the  breeding season, the caruncles are duller and reduced. The eyering is dull bluish.  The bill becomes brownish with pale tip. Legs and feet show dull brownish on  rear of tarsus, joints and webs.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Suliformes Order – Phalacrocoracidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Kerguelen Shag is often considered  a subspecies of the Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), but it differs by its small size and shorter bill, more  rounded wings, all black upperparts (with no white on wings or back), dull brownish  legs and feet and bluish-grey eyering. 
    It is endemic to Kerguelen Islands  in S Indian Ocean. It breeds in colonies along the coasts of some islands of  the archipelago, and forages in open inshore waters. 
    The Kerguelen Shag is not globally  threatened but it has fairly small breeding range.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 65 cm
    Wingspan: 110 cm
    Weight: 1700-2240 g
The Kerguelen Shag adult has black  head, hindneck, upperparts (including wings and tail) and outer part of the  thighs, with blue gloss becoming mostly bronzy green on scapulars and  upperwing. 
    The underparts are white, including  chin, throat, lower cheeks and neck sides. The underwing is blackish with brownish  wash. 
    On the head, we can see a long,  erectile black crest formed by several up curved feathers on crown. The head is  black from crown to malar area, with greenish-blue gloss. 
During the breeding season, there  are some white filoplumes above and behind the eye. The crest is usually lost  as the breeding season progresses, like the filoplumes. The plumage becomes  duller too. 
    We can see conspicuous warty yellow  caruncles on the sides of the forehead. Gape, base of mandibles and gular pouch  are dark brown, and the bare skin is densely covered with numerous tiny yellow tubercles. 
    The eyes are dark brown, surrounded  by broad, blue eyering. The bill is dark grey with brown tinge and paler at  tip. Legs and webbed feet are pink with dark areas on joints and webs.  
Outside the breeding season, the caruncles  become smaller and dull orange-buff, and the eyering is duller. The facial skin  is paler and duller.    
    Male and female are similar. The Kerguelen  Shag resembles other “blue-eyed” shags but it is smaller.  
The juvenile has dark brown  upperparts and a variable amount of dark brown on the underparts. The eyes are  brown. The caruncles are absent. The facial skin is dull and legs and feet are brownish. 
    The immature has more glossy  plumage and gradually acquires the white underparts. 
RANGE:  
    The Kerguelen Shag is endemic to  the Kerguelen Islands in S Indian Ocean, one of the most remote areas on Earth.  It nests on the main island of the archipelago (Grande Terre), on some offshore  islands and on islands in the Golfe du Morbihan (Kerguelen), on the E coast of  Grande Terre. 
HABITAT: 
    The Kerguelen Shag nests on exposed  stretches along the coasts, but also in more sheltered areas. It forages at sea  throughout the islands of the archipelago, often in bays or inlets, usually  within six kilometres of the shore. During summer, if feeds among kelp. 
CALLS AND SOUNDS:
    The Kerguelen Shag male is more  vocal than the female, and usually makes croaking, groaning and growling. The female  produces softer hissing sounds. 
BEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: 
    The Kerguelen Shag feeds on fish  and aquatic invertebrates such as echinoderms, crustaceans and marine worms. Like  all Phalacrocoracidae, it feeds  mainly by pursuit-diving underwater. 
    During the breeding season, it  usually forages alone, but outside this period, they feed in large flocks,  forming linear flocks of several hundred individuals. 
    Some of them feed on introduced  brown trout (Salmo trutta) and brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis) in freshwater  lakes on Kerguelen.  
The Kerguelen Shag breeds in  colonies of 30 to 400 pairs, depending on the island. The male performs the  typical courtship displays such as “Gargling”. It throws its head back until the  nape touches the rump, while the bill is wide open. This display is accompanied  by calls. Both adults share the nesting duties. They are monogamous. 
The Kerguelen Shag is sedentary and  only disperses throughout the islands of the archipelago after the breeding  season. Some immature birds are recorded up to 80 kilometres from the islands,  over the continental shelf. But most colonies are often occupied year-round.  
    The Kerguelen Shag has powerful  flight with regular, continuous wingbeats, sometimes interspersed with glides. 
REPRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The egg laying period varies  depending on the colony. It usually occurs between September and January, with  peak in October/November. The colonies may include 30 to 400 pairs, and they  are sometimes established close to penguin colonies. 
    The nest is a truncated cone made  with grass and seaweeds, cemented together with mud and guano. It is generally  built on cliff ledge or in rock crevice. It can be reused in several following  years if not destroyed. 
The female lays 2-4 eggs and both  adults share the incubation during about one month. At hatching, the chicks are  naked, but a dark brown down growths very soon.  
    They are preyed upon by skuas, gulls and sheathbills,  in spite of heavy protection by their parents.  
PROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS:    
    The Kerguelen Shag is considered  fairly abundant throughout its restricted range. It is not globally threated  outside the natural predation. 
    The population is estimated at  12,000 pairs and appears to be stable. 
    The Kerguelen Shag is currently evaluated  as Least Concern.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Swamp  Harrier is a typical “circus” species, formerly considered a race of the Western Marsh Harrier (Circus  aeruginosus). They are very similar in behaviour, and may appear fairly similar  in plumage in spite of different colours and pattern. 
    This raptor is often seen on exposed perch  on the roadside. It feeds both on carrion and live preys, and it is known for  its spectacular “sky-dancing displays”. This species is commonly seen gliding  above its habitat throughout New Zealand, but it is native, not an endemic bird  species. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  50-60 cm
    Wingspan:  118-145 cm
    Weight:  M: 650 g – F: 850 g
The adult  male has mainly dark brown upperparts with conspicuous white rump, well visible  in flight. Wings and tail are dark brown with darker bars on flight feathers  and rectrices.
    On the  underparts, the breast is creamy-white with brown streaks. Rest of underparts,  including belly, vent and undertail-coverts are whitish. The underwing is creamy-white  too with streaked coverts and barred brown flight feathers with dark tips. 
On the  brown head, we can see conspicuous facial disks giving this bird an owl-like  face mask. 
    The strongly  hooked bill is black with yellow cere. The eyes are yellow with pale yellow  eyering. Legs and feet are pale yellow.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 2 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal  - Lynx Edicions -  ISBN: 8487334156

INTRODUCTION:
    The Pacific Golden Plover was  formerly regarded as the same species that the American Golden Plover until 1993. But these species have different  habits and do not interbreed in W Alaska where the two forms overlap. They do  not winter together. The American Golden Plover migrates to S America while the Pacific Golden Plover flies from  Alaska to Pacific islands and to Australia.  
    The species is not globally  threatened and is now protected, but despite good numbers, the population is  decreasing. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 23-26 cm
    Wingspan: 60-72 cm
    Weight: 100-228 g
The Pacific Golden Plover adult in  breeding plumage has crown, nape, back, upperwing and uppertail densely  spangled with gold, black and white. 
    On the underparts, the black  extends from face and throat down to belly and flanks. The black parts are  bordered with white, and there is a black speckling along the white borders by  underparts and undertail. 
    While the breeding plumage is  developing, the bird shows gradual variations of both colour and marking,  making them difficult to identify. During the moult, the black breast becomes  yellowish-buff with dark speckling, but these parts darken to black as the  breeding plumage is in progress.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The Double-banded  Plover is endemic to New Zealand where it is abundant and widespread on  seashores, in estuaries and riverbeds. It is known as Banded Dotterel in New  Zealand and the Maori’s name is Tutuwhatu. 
    The population  is currently declining, due to introduced mammalian predators which take both  eggs and chicks in the nest on the ground. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:
    Length:  18-21 cm
    Wingspan:  37-42 cm
    Weight:  47-76 g – Race exilis: 78-89 g 
The adult  in breeding plumage has rich grey-brown upperparts but the rump has white sides  and the outer rectrices are whitish. The flight feathers are blackish.   
    The underparts  are white, but we can see a broad chestnut breast band and a narrower black  neck band. 
On the  grey-brown head, there is a narrow, black, frontal bar above the white  forehead. Chin, throat and lower cheeks are white. 
    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are pale grey-green to  yellowish-green.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Terek  Sandpiper is the only member of the genus Xenus. Short-legs and long, upcurved  bill make this bird very distinctive. Its foraging behaviour is more active  than the other Scolopacidae, as it  is frequently seen running about with the prey, in order to wash it before to  swallow it. 
    This species  is threatened by degradation and loss of the habitat, human pressure and  pollution, but the population is currently stable. 
    The first  individual was found in the Terek River on the NE edge of the Caucasus, giving  the bird its English name.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  22-25 cm
    Wingspan:  57-59 cm
    Weight:  50-126 g
The adult  in breeding plumage has grey-brown upperparts with narrow black streaks on  feathers, more conspicuous on scapulars where they form long, blackish lines. Rump,  uppertail-coverts and tail are usually paler grey than rest of upperparts. We can  see whitish tips to feathers in fresh plumage.
    On the  upperwing, the coverts vary from grey-brown to blackish-brown, with broadly  tipped white secondaries, forming a conspicuous trailing edge. 
The underparts  are white with grey wash on the breast, slightly darker and streaked with brown  on the sides, almost forming breast patches. The underwing is white with dark centres  to lesser coverts. 
On the  head, the lores are dark, and we can see a narrow dark line behind the eye. 
    The long-upcurved  bill is blackish with dull orange area at base. The eyes are dark brown,  surrounded by white eyering. Legs and partially webbed feet are bright orange  to greenish-yellow. 
    The bill  may vary in size and curving among individuals, but the females have slightly  larger bill than males.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The Common  Sandpiper is known for its bobbing walk, its flickering flight and the distinctive  white “peak” in front of the wing. 
    This Old  World wader frequents a variety of wetland habitats, both inland and coastal,  although it usually avoids open tidal mudflats. 
    The Common  Sandpiper is migratory and moves S overland on broad front, crossing deserts  and mountains, usually at night. This bird is a small, solitary wader, but  large flocks gather at nightime roosts, sometimes on moored boats. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:  
    Length:  19-21 cm
    Wingspan:  38-41 cm
    Weight:  33-84 g (average 50 g)
The Common  Sandpiper adult has greenish-brown upperparts with fine darker streaks, including  crown, nape and hindneck. In flight, we can see a white wingbar extending from  inner primaries to wing base, and a white trailing edge formed by the tips of  secondaries and inner primaries. The uppertail is like the upperparts, but the  outer rectrices are white and finely barred brown.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew  Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The White-rumped Sandpiper is a  long-distance migratory species, travelling from Canada’s arctic islands to the  southern tip of South America, and even farther to islands lying near the  Antarctic Peninsula. This migration is performed in stages of up to 4000  kilometres that can last up to 60 hours.
    It nests on the arctic tundra,  usually near the coast. On migration and during winter, it frequents a variety  of both inland and coastal wetland habitats. It usually occurs in large flocks  on the wintering grounds. 
    The White-rumped Sandpiper is  threatened by degradation and habitat loss, and the population is suspected to  be decreasing. But currently, the species is not globally threatened.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 15-18 cm
    Wingspan: 36-38 cm
    Weight: 28-66 g
The White-rumped Sandpiper in  breeding plumage has pale chestnut-buff tinge on crown, ear-coverts and scapular  fringes. Shoulder and back feathers are mixed brown and grey. It has white  uppertail-coverts (not rump as mentioned in the name of the bird) contrasting  with the dark rump and tail. 
    On the white underparts, neck  sides, breast and flanks are pale with brown streaking and spotting. 
    The standing bird at rest shows  long primary tip projection beyond the tip of the tail. In flight, we can see a  white band on the uppertail. The male has inflatable throat used during the  displays.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  Volume 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334202

The Ruff  shows an extreme sexual dimorphism, and the male’s ornaments differ  individually in pattern and coloration. 
    The male  in breeding plumage has black barred lower back and tail. Mantle and scapulars  vary from black to brown, chestnut, ochre and white. 
    The  underparts are mostly dark, except the white lower belly, underwing and  undertail.  
Head-tufts  and ruff are highly variable in colour, including buff, chestnut, black-purple,  black or white plumage, often with barred or flecked pattern. 
    The bill  is brown or dull orange. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are  greenish-yellow to bright orange. The facial warts vary from greyish to  yellowish, orange or reddish to brown. 
Males  have a hierarchy based on plumage  colour while displaying.  The males “resident” or “independent males” have darker plumage, especially  head-tufts and ruff, whereas “satellite males” are slightly smaller and usually  have white or very pale ruff and tufts. 
    These  ornamental feathers are visible for relatively short time, usually April to  June. Outside this period, the male resembles female or Reeve in shape and  plumage, but it is significantly larger.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Antarctic Tern ranges throughout the southern oceans and breeds on several  subantarctic islands. It is gregarious while breeding in loose colonies and  fishing in large flocks. The adults often co-operate to defend chicks and nests  against predators. 
    The  species is threatened by introduced mice, cats and rats to some islands, but  most of the breeding areas are now predator-free islands.
    Six  subspecies are currently recognized, but some of them are matter of some debate  and will become probably full species. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:  
Biometrics: 
    Length:  35-40 cm
    Wingspan:  75 cm 
    Weight:  150-180 g
The  adult has grey upperparts including the upperwing where the outer primaries  show variably grey to black outer webs. The rump and the deeply forked tail are  white. 
    The  underparts are greyish-white with white undertail-coverts. 
On the  head, forehead, crown and nape are black, contrasting with the white cheeks.  Chin and malar area are greyish-white like the underparts. 
    Bill,  legs and feet are red. The eyes are dark brown. 
    Both  adults are similar.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Kelp  Gull is present through much of the Southern Hemisphere. According to the  authors, 4 or 5 subspecies are recognized, but Kelp Gull’s taxonomy is still in  a state of uncertainty. As this species has extremely wide range, more  subspecies might be added in the future. However, you will find on this page numerous  pictures from several locations in the Southern Hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:  
    Length:  54-65 cm
    Wingspan:  128-143 cm

The adult  is a typical gull with black upperparts and white tail. On the black upperwing,  the trailing edge is white and the  wing tip shows white patches. 
    Head,  neck, nape, tail and underparts are white.
  The bill  is yellow with red gonydal angle. The  eyes are yellow, surrounded by red or orange eyering. Legs and webbed feet are  greenish-yellow (mostly greyer in Africa).",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Long-tailed Cuckoo belongs to the subfamily Cuculinae which includes the Old World parasitic cuckoos. This  species lays the eggs in the nests of the Mohouidae,  and these tiny birds raise the young cuckoos.
    The  Long-tailed Cuckoo is a long-distance migrant. It breeds in New Zealand, but  after the breeding season, it performs a remarkable overwater migration to  winter in a vast arc of Pacific islands. It migrates at night while uttering  loud shrill notes, giving the bird the name of “screamer”.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  38-42 cm
    Weight:  120-125 g
The  adult male has rufous-barred brown upperparts, including the wings and the long  tail, as long as its body.
    The  underparts are white to rufous and streaked black from chin to vent. The  streaks are usually thick. 
The head  is blackish streaked rufous. There is a conspicuous white supercilium, and we  can see a dark moustachial stripe contrasting with the white lower cheek. 
    The bill  is yellow to horn-coloured. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are greyish. 
Both  sexes are similar, but some birds can be more rufous and are often females. 
    The  juvenile has dark brown, heavily spotted creamy-white upperparts. The  underparts are more or less tinged pale brownish, with thinner streaks than in  adults. The dark tail is barred whitish.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 4 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334229

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Buffy Fish-Owl feeds exclusively on fish and a variety of aquatic organisms. Some  morphological features are well-adapted to its feeding behaviour. This species  is rarely seen far from water, usually in forested areas and even close to  human habitations. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  40-48 cm
    Weight:  1030-2100 g
The  Buffy Fish-Owl is the smallest of the four fish-owls. 
    The adult  has buff upperparts with dark brown streaks and pale rufous edges to feathers. The  scapulars are paler, mostly whitish to pale buff. On the wings, the flight  feathers are barred buff and dark brown, with a few whitish bars. The rectrices  are dark brown with pale tips and a few buffish-white bars. 
The underparts  are warm buff with dark brown streaks, more conspicuous on neck and breast, and  thinner and sparser on belly and flanks. 
Head and  neck are similar to the upperparts, but the feathers lack the pale tips. Forehead  and eyebrows are white. The facial disk is pale buff. The floppy ear-tufts are  directed sideward, stilted at 45 degrees.
    The bill  is black. The eyes are yellow. The long, yellowish-grey tarsi are unfeathered  along with the toes. The soles of the feet are covered with spiny scales. The claws  are dark horn.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 5 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal  - Lynx Edicions -  ISBN: 8487334253

Passeriformes Order – Rhipiduridae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The New  Zealand Fantail was named « this fairy of the bush » by William  Herbert Guthrie-Smith, naturalist and birdwatcher born in 1862 in Scotland. 
    This pretty  bird is moving continuously and the long, flickering fanned tail is constantly  used in flight, during displays and while foraging and feeding. 
    It is  mainly a forest species, but it is well-adapted to human developments and has  become quite confiding. Its local Maori’s name is “Piwakawaka”. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  14-17 cm
    Weight:  6,5 - 9 g 
There  are two colour morphs. The pied morph (here displayed) is more common than the  black morph which is about 12/25% of South I population, and less than 1% of  North I birds.    
The  adult male of nominate race has olive-brown upperparts. The upperwing is dark  brown with double white wingbar formed by the whitish tips of greater and  median wing-coverts. The inner secondaries are edged whitish too. On the  uppertail, the central rectrices are brownish-black and show white shafts and  tips. The tail feathers 2-5 are white, with brownish-black edges to outer webs. The outer rectrices are  greyish-white.",,"HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 11 by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott and David  Christie - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 849655306X

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Brown Shrike is a small, migratory shrike, often seen perched in upright stance.  This is a very typical shrike that hunts from perches and impales prey on horny  branches.  
    This  species breeds in central and eastern Asia, and spends the winter in India, SE  Asia and Indonesia. It frequents open country with bushes and scattered trees. 
    The  Brown Shrike has four subspecies that differ in plumage pattern and coloration. 
    This  species is not globally threatened, although its population is declining. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  17-20 cm
    Weight:  M: 27-34 gr – F: 28-37 gr
The  Brown Shrike adult male of nominate race has rufous-brown crown and nape and  slightly duller upperparts, except the rump and the uppertail-coverts that are slightly  brighter. The upperwing is mostly dark brown with wing-coverts and inner  flight-feathers edged whitish. The tail is dull rufous, with paler edges and  tips on outer rectrices. 
The  underparts are whitish with pale rufous tinge, except on the white chin and  throat. The undertail-coverts are pale brownish-grey.
On the  head, crown and nape are rufous-brown. We can see a conspicuous black facial  mask extending from lores through the eye to rear ear-coverts. There is a broad  white supercilium. The lower forehead is creamy-white.
    The  hooked bill is black. The eyes are brown. Legs and feet are blackish.",,"HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 13 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions – ISBN: 9788496553453
