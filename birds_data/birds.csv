This species prefers virgin forests where it can live free from disturbances. 
    It is often found at medium elevation, in dense  tropical rainforest, but also in galleries and swamp forests.","Southern Cassowary is the second largest and tallest  bird after the Ostrich. This species differs in general facts by the female.  She has the criterions of most of the other species’ males, such as brighter  colours, really much larger size, and she does not share the nesting duties  with the male.","Southern Cassowary lives in Aru and Seram Islands  of Indonesia, in New Guinea and NE Australia.","Southern Cassowary does not fly. Its powerful legs and  feet allow it to run at speeds of up to 50 km per hour. It is able to jump up to 5 metres. It also can  swim, and cross lakes and wide rivers without any difficulty.","Breeding season starts at the end of the dry season in  New Guinea, and from June to  October in Queensland. 
    The female copulates with several males, and  disappears as soon as the eggs are laid. 
    The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the  ground, with a lining of leaves and grasses. It is very well camouflaged in the  vegetation. 
    She lays 3 to 5 greenish eggs. Incubation by the male  lasts about 50 days. The male rears the chicks during about 9 months.","Southern Cassowary feeds mainly on fallen fruits of  different plant’s species. It also consumes invertebrates, small vertebrates  and sometimes carrion.","Southern Cassowary is fairly widespread in New Guinea, but  declines due to habitat loss and hunting occurred. Disturbances are also an  important fact in local declines.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep  del  Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It can be found both on coastal and inland regions, and at any elevation. They  breed in grassland, heath or woodland. 
    This  species usually avoids the rainforest and the very dry areas.","The Emu is  a flightless bird, but the long, powerful legs make it well adapted for walking  and running over wide areas. This is the second largest living bird, after the Ostrich.","The Emu  is found in Australia, but apart from desert areas and some south-western regions.  This species has been introduced to Kangaroo Island and Maria Island, off S  Australia.","The Emu  is flightless, but it walks easily and can run very fast.","The  breeding season starts in December-January with egg-laying in April-May. 
    The  reproduction of the Emu is based on successive polyandry of the females, while  their mates perform all the nesting duties. 
    After  pairing in December-January, the male builds the nest, a shallow depression on  the ground made with twigs, leaves and grass, in the shelter of some vegetation  but with a good view of the surrounding area.","The Emu  is omnivorous, but it feeds regularly on highly nutritious food. It feeds on  seeds, fruits, flowers and tender roots. In summer, large quantities of insects  are eaten, especially caterpillars, grasshoppers and beetles. It also takes small  vertebrates. 
    Coprophagy  is also recorded in order to avoid deshydratation in dry areas where food  resources are scarce. In suitable habitat, it drinks 2-3 times a day.","The Emu  has stable populations. This species has benefited from human alterations to  the environment, such as water supplies and fences which protect them from  predators. 
    The Emu  is not currently threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Several legends tell numerous wonderful stories about this  beautiful bird. Thanks to its beauty and popularity, the species has been  protected both in its native and introduced ranges.
    Very common in India, the Indian Peafowl is found in  almost all villages and protected under Indian Wildlife Protection act, 1972.","The Indian Peafowl is found in Pakistan, throughout  India to Sri Lanka, and maybe still in Bangladesh.

The Canada Goose is a large goose  with black head and long neck, and conspicuous white patch on the cheek,  extending under the chin and forming a “chin strap”. 
    The upperparts are largely brown,  with pale edges to feathers, forming indistinct bars. Lower back, rump and tail  are black, contrasting with the white V on tail’s base. On the upperwing, the  flight feathers are darker. 
    The underparts are paler, with whitish  breast and yellowish flanks. Lower belly and undertail-coverts are white; the  underwing is dark brown. 
    Bill, legs and webbed feet are  black. The eyes are dark brown.       
    Male and female are similar in  plumage, but the male is larger than the female. 
    The juvenile resembles adults, but  it is duller overall, with brownish head and neck, and pale brownish wash on  cheek patches.","CIES AND RANGE:  
    The Canada Goose has seven  subspecies which differ mainly in size, proportions and coloration. The  southern races are larger with large bills, whereas the northern subspecies are  smaller, with small bills, but with long wings (because they are migratory).",,"OF THIS SPECIES:     
    The breeding season varies  depending on the range, but it usually takes place in spring. The Canada Goose  nests in single pairs or in colonies. 
    The nest-site is chosen by the  female, often on slightly elevated dry ground but near water, allowing good visibility  all around. However, the Canada Goose may also nest on cliff ledges, in trees  and on artificial structures. The female builds a shallow depression, a bowl  made with sticks, grass, weeds and moss, and lined with down.",,"The Canada Goose is often a common  resident of urban lakes and parks in many areas, and this species responds well  to management on wildlife refuges. 
    Eggs and chicks are taken by  several predators such as coyotes, arctic fox, northern raccoon, red fox, large  gulls, Common Raven, American Crow, Carrion Crow (in Europe), Bald  Eagle, Golden Eagle and bears.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    Female lays 5 to 14 creamy-coloured eggs. Incubation  lasts about 30 to 33 days, by female. Male defends the nest-site and protects  her. 
    Downy chicks leave the nest, and parents lead them  through the territory when they are two days old. They remain in family group  during the first six weeks. Young become independent when they fledge.","Australian Shelduck feeds mainly on short grasses by  grazing, and seeds, tubers, cereals and vegetables crops. It also consumes  aquatic invertebrates (insects and molluscs) and submerged vegetation, by  dabbling.","Australian Shelduck is not very popular as game bird.  But they can be killed because they damage cereal and vegetable crops when they  feed in agricultural fields. Damage license is required for shooting outside  open season.
    Australian Shelduck populations are increasing since  recent years, due to more irrigation in cultivated areas, giving them more wet  areas.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep  del  Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    This species is able to adapt to man-made wetlands,  producing increase of populations in several parts of the range.
    The African race “infuscatus” is locally common. The  Australasian race “australis” is uncommon but stable in Australia.  Declines occurred in New    Zealand with arrival of Europeans and the  species is now threatened, unable to recover from effects of past persecution.  But recent observations suggest some stability of the populations. 
    Currently, the Great-crested Grebe is not threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew   Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Columbiformes Order – Columbidae family
INTRODUCTION: 
    This  large Columbidae is endemic to New Zealand where it is also known as Kereru,  and Kukupa in Northland. 
    This  arboreal species feeds mainly on fruit and flowers, and may fly long distances  to find its preferred food items. 
    The New  Zealand Pigeon is protected, but it is still hunted illegally in some forests,  and it is a good prey for the introduced mammalian predators.
    The  Chatham Island Pigeon is usually considered a separate species and will be  studied later.
    The Norfolk  Island Pigeon (H.n. spadicea) is extinct due to hunting and predation.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  50-51 cm
    Weight: 630-650  g
The  adult is a heavily built bird with iridescent metallic green upperparts. Nape,  mantle, scapulars and lesser wing-coverts show purple and bronze reflections.  Back and rump are duller, with pale silvery grey tinge on rump,  uppertail-coverts and bases of primaries, often conspicuous in flight. The tail  is blackish-brown with indistinct paler tip. There is a narrow white band  between the breast and the folded wing.","The New  Zealand Pigeon is found throughout New Zealand, including the larger offshore  islands that have suitable forest or shrubland habitats.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The  breeding season takes place from September to March, with peak in  December-January related to abundance of food. 
    The nest  is placed in tree. This is a flimsy, shallow structure made with thin twigs and  usually unlined. The nest is hidden among the dense foliage and well shaded  from the sun.",,"The New  Zealand Pigeon is widespread but the numbers are gradually declining due to  habitat loss, predation and illegal hunting.
    The main  predators are rats, stoats, cats and possums which eat both eggs and chicks. Although  fully protected in New Zealand, the New Zealand Pigeon is still illegally  hunted in some areas. Continual logging and degradation of native forests, and  competition for fruit resources affect the species too. 
    The New  Zealand Pigeon is the only one able to disperse large seeds over wide areas. 
    The  species is currently classified as Near Threatened, but the global population  size is unknown. However, it is described as not uncommon.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 4 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334229

The breeding  colonies are established on flat, sloping or sometimes steep areas, usually in  dense tussac grassland or heath. 
    Outside the  breeding season, it is marine and pelagic. It can be found in the cool waters over  the edge of the continental shelf in subantarctic zone.","Garrodia nereis
Procellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is included in the subfamily Oceanitinae in the family  Hydrobatidae. It is the only member of the genus Garrodia. This species occurs  in Southern Ocean. It differs from other storm-petrels by the grey back and  inner part of the wing, and the pale grey rump instead of white. 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is vulnerable on land, and predation by the Brown Skua is a major threat at breeding colonies. It is mainly  solitary, although sometimes seen in small groups. They nest in loose colonies. 
    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is the smallest storm-petrel in the New Zealand region, but this  sparrow-sized bird has very powerful flight in full force gales in New Zealand subantarctic  waters.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  16-19 cm
    Wingspan:  39-40 cm
    Weight:  35 g (21-44 g)
The adult  has blackish-grey head, throat, neck and upper breast, whereas mantle, back and  wings are dark grey. On the upperwing, two pale wingbars are formed by the pale  grey tips of both median and greater coverts. Rump and uppertail-coverts are  pale grey to silvery grey. The rectrices are darker grey at base, and mostly blackish-grey  at tip, forming a dark terminal band. 
    In fresh  plumage, the upperparts have scaly appearance due to the pale-tipped feathers. 
    The underparts  are white and contrast strongly with the dark hood. On the underwing, the  trailing edge is dark grey and the leading edge is dark and broader. The flanks  may sometimes show grey streaks while some grey bars are visible on the  undertail-coverts. 
    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are grey-black. 
    Male and  female have similar appearance, although female is usually larger overall. 
    The juvenile  is similar to adults.","The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel has circumpolar range. It occurs in Southern Ocean in Falklands,  South Georgia, Gouth, Crozet, Kerguelen, Auckland, Antipodes, Chatham and  possibly Macquarie Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel establishes the breeding colonies on oceanic islands. These colonies  are mainly active between August and April. The pre-laying exodus lasts about  two weeks. The birds are strictly nocturnal around their nests to avoid predation.
The nest  is mainly above the ground instead of excavated burrow. It is very well hidden  among the dense vegetation, usually a clump of tussock grass or flax. For better  protection, the birds build a small tunnel leading to the nest but invisible in  the vegetation. However, this species may also nest in rock crevices.",,"The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is affected by predation on the breeding grounds by the Short-eared Owl in Falklands, and elsewhere  by skuas, rats and cats. All predators  take adults, eggs and chicks. Declines are reported due to fairly accessible  nesting sites. Another problem comes from the livestock, involving trampling  and degradation of the vegetation on the breeding grounds. 
    The global  population is estimated at 200,000 individuals, with the main concentration on  the islands around New Zealand.
    But currently,  the Grey-backed Storm-Petrel is evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Fregetta tropica
Procellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel occurs throughout the Southern Ocean and breeds on  several subantarctic islands. As it prefers cold waters, it is a true  subantarctic breeder.
    The genus  Fregetta includes two main species, but actually, there are six distinct forms.  They belong to the Southern Subfamily Oceanitinae that shows great taxonomy diversity. 
    This species  is threatened by invasive and introduced predators to their breeding islands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  20 cm
    Wingspan:  43-46 cm
    Weight:  43-63 g
The adult  has rather compact body with rounded wings and short, square-tipped tail.
    Head,  neck, breast and upperparts including wings and tail, are blackish-brown, whereas  rump and belly are white. Black vent and central belly stripe are variable. This  stripe connects the blackish throat and breast to vent and undertail-coverts. On  the underwing, flight feathers and leading edge are blackish, whereas the  underwing-coverts are white in the centre of the wing. On the upperwing, the  coverts are browner than the blackish flight feathers. We can see some pale  fringes to scapulars and tips of greater coverts, forming an indistinct panel  even in fresh plumage. The undertail is blackish. 
The bill  is black and hooked at tip. The long, tubular, external nostrils might allow  the bird to detect food by smell. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet  are black. 
Both adults  are similar although the female has slightly larger wings, tail and tarsus. 
    The juvenile  resembles adult.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel has two subspecies.
F.t. tropica (described and displayed) is found from  islands of Scotia Arc, through South Indian Ocean to Antipodes Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The egg-laying  occurs between December and February. The Black-bellied Storm-Petrel breeds in  loose colonies among broken rocks or in excavated burrows in soft soil and  peat.",,"The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel is widespread in its range. The global population  was estimated at about 500,000 individuals in 2004. Some declines are  suspected, due to predation by invasive and introduced mammals such as mice,  rats and cats, but also by natural avian predators including skuas and owls. 
    The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It comes to land only for breeding. It spends  most of the time at sea, gliding above the waves. It occurs more often inshore  in the Australasian part of the range. 
    This species  breeds on remote islands. The nest is built on slopes, on exposed ridges or  hillocks for easier take-off. The ground can be covered with scattered tussock  grass.","medea exulans
Procellariiforme Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    With a  wingspan of 350 cm, the Wandering Albatross has the largest wings of any living  bird. Its weight ranges from 6300 to 11300 grams, and the immature can be  larger while performing its first flight, as it still has fat reserves. This large  size is more impressive when the bird is gliding easily above the waves. 
    Its other  English names are Snowy Albatross and White-winged Albatross. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  107-135 cm
    Wingspan:  254-351 cm
    Weight:  6250-11300 g
The adult  has snowy white plumage overall, except on the black-and-white wings. It  becomes whiter with the age. Mantle and scapulars are white with very narrow blackish  vermiculations extending to the upperwing-coverts.
    The underparts  are entirely white, but the underwing shows black tip and trailing edge. 
    There are  variations, and some birds may have brownish-grey crown, whereas others have  washed pale pink or pale orange ear-coverts. 
    The hooked  bill is pink with pale yellowish tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed  feet are pale grey.","CIES AND RANGE:  
D.e. exulans (here described) is found in Southern Ocean  from South Georgia E to Antipodes islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season starts in November, but the Wandering Albatross has biennial  reproduction due to the long breeding cycle. This species breeds in loose  colonies, usually in scattered groups of some nests.",,"The main  threats for the Wandering Albatross come from the longline fleets. This species  has wide foraging range and often encounters these dangerous fishing systems.  
    The chicks  are threatened by accumulation of debris and fishing hooks which are swallowed  by the young birds. Introduced cats and rats by sealers involve predation of  young chicks at nest. In some parts of the range, and especially at South Georgia,  habitat loss and degradation due to fur seal activities, have involved some  population declines. 
    Currently,  the Wandering Albatross is considered Vulnerable.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It forages in  S Pacific E of New Zealand and E as far as Chilean waters.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The Antipodean  Albatross usually breeds biennially if successful. The laying occurs around January  on Antipodes Islands and around February on Chatham Islands. 
    The race  “gibsoni” breeds mostly in late December  on the Auckland Islands. 
    The nest  is a low truncated cone made with soil, twigs and roots, and the shallow  depression at top is sometimes lined with grass. It is often placed in open or  in scattered tussock grass or shrubs, and from coastline to inland areas such  as slopes or plateau.",,"The Antipodean  Albatross is affected by introduced predators such as pigs, cats, rats and mice  on some breeding islands. However, the main threat is at sea where the birds  take bait from hooks. Numerous birds are killed by long-line fisheries,  involving important declines over several following years. The global warming  also changes the ocean conditions and reduces prey abundance.
    In 2009,  the global population was estimated to number 44,500 mature individuals. There were  4,565 breeding pairs on Antipodes Islands in 2007/2009, and 3,277 pairs in the  Auckland group between 2006 and 2009. 
    The Antipodean  Albatross has reduced breeding range on some subantarctic islands. It is currently  classified as Vulnerable, but following declines, it could be reclassified as  Endangered or even Critically Endangered.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN:  8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The  Northern Royal Albatross was formerly a subspecies of the Royal Albatross (D. epomophora),  but since 1998, it is a full species. 
    The  scientific name “sanfordi” pays tribute to Leonard Cutler Sanford (1868-1950),  ornithologist and trustee of the American Museum of Natural History. 
    The  local Maori’s name is “Toroa”.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  115 cm
    Wingspan:  270-305 cm
    Weight:  6200-8200 g
The  adult has white body plumage including the upperparts. However, the upperwing  is black, whereas the underwing is white, except the black leading edge from  the carpal joint to the wingtip. The tail is white, and can be sometimes  black-tipped.   
The head  is white, although some females may have black-speckled crown.
    The  hooked bill is pale pink. The upper mandible shows a black cutting edge. The  eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pale pink to flesh. 
    During  the nesting period, bill and tarsi are darker pink.","The  Northern Royal Albatross breeds in New Zealand, on South Island, in Otago  Peninsula, and in the Chatham Islands (Forty-fours, Big and Little Sister  Islands).
    Outside  the breeding season, most population can be found off both coasts of Southern  South America, especially over the continental shelf and slope off Chile, and  the Patagonian shelf off Argentina.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The  Northern Royal Albatross returns to the same nesting-site every year, usually  in October or November. They breed every two years because the cycle is long.  They can breed at 9-10 years old. 
    The nest  is on the ground. It is made with grasses and mud, forming a shallow  depression. 
    The  female lays a single white egg. Both adults share the long incubation period  during 11 weeks (77-79 days). They take turns of 2 days to 3 weeks, but usually  of 8 days. The chick needs 3-6 days to emerge from the shell, after piercing it  with the bill’s nail.",,"The  Northern Royal Albatross is often killed by longline fishing every year, in  spite of protection measures. Harvesting of eggs, chicks and adults by local  residents still occur on Chatham Islands. Storms and climatic changes also  affect albatrosses. Introduced mammals are controlled and conservation measures  are on their way. 
    However,  the Northern Royal Albatross has very restricted range and is currently listed  as Endangered. The population is estimated at 17,000 mature individuals. The  population of Chatham Islands is about 99% of the total, and estimated at  6,500/7,000 pairs, with 5,200/5,800 breeding pairs each year (2003). Only 25  pairs breed every year at Taiaroa head.    
    But the  numbers of breeding pairs appear relatively stable.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It breeds on bare oceanic islands, sometimes with low  vegetation, in open sandy or grassy areas. However, it usually prefers flat  grounds with some vegetal cover and protection from the wind.","stria immutabilis
Procellariiforme Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    Although  the Laysan Albatross is a species of the Northern Hemisphere, its breeding  habits are those of a bird of the Southern hemisphere. Actually, it breeds  during the local winter which corresponds to the austral summer, suggesting  that this species originated in the S Hemisphere. It has probably spread northwards  centuries ago, into the Northern Pacific where it is now resident.  
    Albatrosses  are long-lived birds, and the Laysan Albatross may reach 40 years and more. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  79-81 cm
    Wingspan:  195-203 cm
    Weight:  2300-3200 g
The  adult has blackish-grey upperparts whereas head, lower rump and underparts are  white. The underwing pattern may vary between birds which show narrow black  margins and variable amounts of black on the underwing-coverts. 
    On the  white head, a grey patch extends from chin to cheeks and ear-coverts. It can be  sometimes indistinct from distance, except around the eye where the colour  becomes almost black. 
    The  typical bill is pink with grey tip on both mandibles, and the upper one has  hooked tip. The eyes are dark brown, with pale grey eyering, mostly white  below. Legs and webbed feet are pale pinkish-grey.","The  Laysan Albatross breeds in NW Hawaiian Archipelago, but mainly on Laysan and  Midway Islands. It also breeds off Baja California, and a more recent colony is  established on Bonin Islands, off SE Japan.
    During  the non-breeding season, this species is living out at sea in N Pacific Ocean,  as far North as Bering Sea, and E to the Pacific coast of North America. 
    They are  more numerous on the west side of N Pacific, and other populations are found in  Canada, Japan, Mexico and Norfolk Island in the Pacific Ocean.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season starts in November. 
    The  Laysan Albatross breeds in colonies, sometimes large ones, and often in company  of the Black-footed Albatross (P.  nigriceps). 
    The nest  is built by both adults. This is a shallow depression in the sand. Some debris  mixed with sand can form a substantial rim.",,"The  Laysan Albatross suffered large declines in the late 1800s, with feather and  egg collecting. But populations have recovered until these practices have been banned  in 1909. 
    Man-related  mortality at sea, predation by rats, cats and dogs, plastic ingestion, lead  poisoning and human disturbances are the main threats for this species which is  currently evaluated as Near Threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    Some observations  mention birds feeding on freshwater lake at Tierra del Fuego, about 35 km  inland. 
    It breeds  on remote islands, with nests built on steep slopes among tussock grass, or on  cliff ledges.","halassarche melanophris
Procellariiforme Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    Formerly,  two subspecies were included under the same name, with the nominate T.m.  melanophris, and the other race T.m. impavida. They are now considered as  separate species under the names Black-browed Albatross and Campbell Albatross,  from recent genetic studies of DNA. However, some disagreement is continuing,  suggesting that genetic divergences between the two subspecies are not  sufficient to separate them. 
(The Campbell Albatross is mentioned here in  the subspecies, but it will be studied later as full species.) 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  83-93 cm
    Wingspan:  240 cm
    Weight: 3000-5000  g. The race “impavida” is slightly smaller. 
The Black-browed Albatross  adult has blackish-brown back, upperwing and tail, whereas head, neck, mantle,  rump, uppertail-coverts and underparts are white. However, the underwing shows  broad black leading edge and narrower black trailing edge, and black wing tip  too.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    Two subspecies  were formerly recognized:
T.m. melanophris (here described and displayed) is found in  Southern Ocean, from Cape Horn, E to Antipodes islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season is annual and starts in September/October. 
    The Black-browed  Albatross builds a large nest with roots, grass and mud, a truncated cone with  a depression at top. Within a colony, the nests are about one metre apart. 
    They breed  on remote islands, among tussock grass on steep slopes or on cliff ledges. 
    They are  territorial during the nesting period, and may peck at other birds coming too  close to the nest.",,"The Black-browed  Albatross, like numerous seabirds, is threatened by long-line fishing fleets. Introduced  species such as cats and rats, disturb the colonies and kill the chicks. Oil and  chemical pollutions, added to plastic ingestion also threaten these birds at  sea and on land. Competition for food with fisheries can be potentially  significant too.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Grey-headed  Albatross breeds on several sub Antarctic islands, with the main populations on  South Georgia, Campbell and Macquarie Islands. This species is threatened by  long-lines fishing which kills a significant proportion of populations. 
    The breeding  adults are known for their long-distance flights in search of food for their  chicks. The maximum foraging ranges have been recorded to be 500-800/1850 km  from their nest. They are graceful and powerful fliers. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  81 cm
    Wingspan:  180-220 cm
    Weight: 3000-3750  g
The adult  has wholly grey head, neck and mantle. On the upperparts, back, scapulars and  upperwing are darker, mostly blackish-brown. Outer primaries show white shafts.  The tail is grey.
    On the  underparts, the underwing is white. The blackish margins are broader than most  of Diomedeidae, with the broadest part on the basal third of the leading edge. Breast,  belly, vent and undertail-coverts are white.","The Grey-headed  Albatross has circumpolar distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. It breeds on  sub Antarctic islands in South Georgia, Chilean offshore islands, Iles Kerguelen,  Iles Crozet, Marion Island, Prince Edward Island, Campbell Island and Macquarie  Island.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The Grey-headed  Albatross returns to the breeding grounds between early September and early October.  The breeding season lasts 10-11 months.

Procellariiformes Order – Diomedeidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Sooty  Albatross is included in the genus Phoebetria alongside the Light-mantled Albatross (P. palpebrata).  Both birds have dark plumage and look very similar. However, they differ in  courtship displays and timing of breeding. Both differ from genus Diomedea in  having more pointed and narrower wings, longer wedge-shaped tail and peculiar  head pattern. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  84-89 cm
    Wingspan:  200-203 cm
    Weight:  M: 2200-3250 g – F: 2100-2800 g
The adult  has entirely sooty-brown plumage with browner head and neck and very dark face.  Belly, wings and tail are variably darker whereas neck and body are slightly paler. 
    In worn  plumage, hindneck to mantle can be much paler and contrast with the head. On the  wings, the white shafts of the outer primaries are conspicuous, and can be seen  even at distance. 
The bill  is black and shows yellowish-pink stripe on the sides of the lower mandible,  but this stripe does not reach the bill tip. The eyes are dark grey to dark  brown, surrounded by broad, white eyering, becoming narrower and broken on  lores. Legs and webbed feet are pale pinkish to bluish-grey. 
    Both adults  are similar, but the female is smaller than male.","The Sooty  Albatross occurs in both South Atlantic and Indian Oceans off the coasts of  South America, South Africa and Australia. This species breeds from Tristan da Cunha and Gough (the largest  population), E to Kerguelen, (only a few pairs), Amsterdam and St Paul.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season starts in July/August and runs until December. The colony is established  among vegetation on steep slopes and sea cliffs on remote islands. The birds  nest in small groups of 50-60 pairs or sometimes solitary. 
    The nest  is a low, truncated conical structure made with moss, grass and mud. It is up  to 20 centimetres high with a central depression often lined with grass.",,"The Sooty  Albatross is threatened by longline fishing gear which is still used today in  the Australian waters, and ingestion of hooks and plastic. The breeding  failures are caused by introduced predators such as rats and cats on the  breeding islands.
    The population  is estimated at about 28,000 mature individuals and decreasing. 
    The Sooty  Albatross is currently considered Endangered, due to rapid decline over three generations  (90 years).","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Southern  Giant Petrel is very similar to the Northern  Giant Petrel (M. halli), but the southern species has two distinct colour  morphs, dark and white. 
    Until the  1960s, they were not identified as separate species, but more detailed study of  their breeding biology indicated that they were two distinct species. They  breed side by side on Macquarie Island. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  86-99 cm
    Wingspan:  185-205 cm
    Weight: M:  5 kg – F: 3,8 kg 
DARK MORPH 
    The adult  has grey-brown plumage with paler, faded, mottled white head, neck and breast. 
    The underparts  are dark from lower breast to undertail-coverts. On the underwing, the bases of  the outer flight feathers are silvery and the leading edge is pale near the  body, unlike the Northern  Giant Petrel in which this area is dark brown.","The Southern  Giant Petrel has circumpolar distribution in Southern Ocean. It breeds in Antarctica  and from S Chile and SC Argentina, E through the sub Antarctic islands to Heard  I and Macquarie I.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season starts in July, but it depends on the range.
    The Southern  Giant Petrel breeds in loose colonies of up to 300 pairs, established on open coastal  plateaux and headlands or gentle slopes, in open vegetation but not in tussock  like the Northern  Giant Petrel.  
    The nest  is built by both adults. This is a low large cup made with grass, moss, small stones  and bones. But sometimes, it is only a scratch in grass, sand or rocks.",,"The Southern  Giant Petrel is still killed (caught and drowned) on illegal longline fisheries  in Southern Ocean, and in trawl fisheries in the Falkland Islands. But thanks  to better management of these techniques, this threat is now reduced around  some breeding colonies. 
    Some declines  are caused by reduction of carrion, human disturbances, persecution, ingestion  of debris and oil pollution at sea. 
    The population  size is estimated at 65,000/100,000 mature individuals, and the Southern Giant Petrel  is not currently threatened.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It breeds on islands, from  South Georgia, across South Indian Ocean to New Zealand surroundings.",,"Breeding  season usually begins in August. Northern Giant-Petrel is solitary nester, but  it can breed in loose colonies, and sometimes close to Southern Giant-Petrels,  among tussocks in vegetation, on rocky slopes and broken terrain areas. 
    The nest  is situated on the ground. Northern Giant-Petrel builds a cup with twigs,  grass, leaves and ferns. It is a pile of vegetation, often of 50 to 60 cm high, but it depends on  material availability. The depression at the top is shallow.","Northern  Giant-Petrel feeds mainly on seals and penguins carcasses at sea or on land,  dead penguins and also discarded fish and refuse from ships. 
    The female  feeds mainly on live preys caught at sea, such as krill and aquatic  invertebrates.","Northern  Giant-Petrels populations are not currently globally threatened, and we  can see some increase, particularly at South Georgia,  due to increase of seals numbers, with good availability of food resources. Population size: 11,000/14,000 mature individuals. 
    Predators  such as introduced cats and rats, disturbances at colonies and accidents when  they follow ships, play an important role in mortality of this species.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep  del  Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Antarctic  Petrel is included in the “fulmar-petrel” group in the family Procellariidae. This  species is distinct enough to be placed in the separate, monotypic genus  Thalassoica.
    It is an  agile flier and is very active on the water. It appears less clumsy on land  than most other petrels. It rarely wanders far from pack ice and icebergs. It breeds  in dense colonies and its population is large and currently stable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  40-46 cm
    Wingspan:  100-110 cm
    Weight:  510-765 g
The adult  is a medium-sized petrel with dark chocolate-brown and white plumage. 
    It has  dark brown hood and upperparts to rump. Uppertail-coverts and tail are white, except  the dark brown terminal band. 
    On the  upperwing, the anterior half is dark brown and includes the primary-coverts and  the outer primaries. The rear half is white and forms a broad white wingbar on  secondaries to inner primaries. The dark brown feather tips form a narrow  trailing edge broken on inner primaries. 
The underparts  are white except the dark terminal tail band, the broad dark brown leading edge  and the narrow trailing edge. 
    The transition  between the white underparts and the dark hood is not very sharp. The central  area is whitish up to chin, whereas the dark area extends from breast sides to  axillaries. 
The head  is entirely dark brown. The bill is blackish-brown, slightly tinged dull olive  on sides. The eyes are blackish. Legs and webbed feet are greyish with some  pinkish tinge especially on webs.","The Antarctic  Petrel is found in Southern Ocean. It breeds on coastal Antarctica and up to  250 kilometres inland and on surrounding islands. 
    The species  ranges widely N to S South America, South Africa, Tasmania and New Zealand.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season starts in November, following a pre-laying exodus of 3-4 weeks in  October/November. 
    They are  monogamous, but occasionally, a breeding female may be joined by an unsuccessful  female and they rear the chick together. In addition, a female may sometimes  mate with the neighbour male, because a high proportion of females can be  frequent in some colonies. 
    They breed  in colonies established on cliff ledges or among rocks, in hollows. The nest is  a shallow depression sparsely lined with small pebbles, bones or feathers.",,"The Antarctic  Petrel has large range and its populations are stable. The global population  may number several millions birds, ranging between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000  individuals in 2004.

Pachyptila belcheri
Procellariiformes Order – Procellariidae family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Slender-billed  Prion is very similar to the five other species of genus Pachyptila. It is a  very typical prion with the dark M-shaped pattern across the upperwing. This species  is common in Southern Ocean and breeds on subantarctic islands where it nests  in burrow on coastal slopes. It is gregarious while feeding at sea at abundant food  sources. They breed colonially and are monogamous.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  25-28 cm
    Wingspan:  56 cm
    Weight:  145 g
The adult  has pale grey to pale grey-blue upperparts including wings and tail, slightly  darker on forehead and crown. The upperwing has a transversal dark M from  wingtip to wingtip. The uppertail is paler on sides, with black band on central  tips. 
    The underparts  are entirely white including underwing and undertail, except the dark area on  central rectrices.","The Slender-billed  Prion occurs in Southern Ocean. It breeds on subantarctic islands such as  Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, and also on Noir Island off S Chile, and in the Falkland Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season starts in October/November in Falklands, and later on Kerguelen. 
    It nests  in self-excavated burrow in soft soil on grassy coastal slopes. The burrow is  about 0,6-3,5 metres deep, and is lined with grass and feathers.",,"The Slender-billed  Prion is affected by predation by introduced cats and rats, and by natural predators  such as Striated Caracara and skuas on some breeding islands. However,  the recent elimination of some introduced predators has involved increase and  expansion of populations in Falklands.   
    The global  population is estimated at least as 7,000,000 individuals, and is suspected to  be stable.  
    The Slender-billed  Prion is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Fairy  Prion is the smallest species of the genus Pachyptila and shows the  characteristic blackish M on the upperwings. 
    It is  found in the Southern Ocean. It breeds in colonies and nests in burrows or rock  crevices, usually on small islands. 
    The name  of this species comes from its most typical call, a faint coo fairly similar to  that of some doves. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:

Procellariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Westland  Petrel is one of the few petrels still breeding on New Zealand mainland. Although  being the largest burrowing petrel, this species is vulnerable to introduced  dogs and cats, and also stoats and rats, whereas pigs destroy the nesting burrows. 
    The Westland  Petrel suffered heavy degradation of the habitat due to human activities. However,  it inhabits much of the same breeding range as it did formerly, prior to human  habitations. This species is endemic to New Zealand.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  50-55 cm
    Wingspan:  135-140 cm
    Weight:  800-1200 g
The adult  has sooty-black plumage overall, including head and neck which are often  darker. However, a few birds may have some odd white feathers. 
    On the  underwing, the bases of primaries and coverts are greyer and slightly paler. 
    The bill  is ivory to pale yellowish, with blackish culmen and tips of both mandibles. The  eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are blackish. 
    Male and  female have similar appearance.
    The juvenile  resembles adult but it has whiter bill.","The Westland  Petrel occurs on the West Coast of the South island. They breed in coastal  forests in the foothills of the Paparoa Range, near Punakaiki on South Island. 
    During winter,  it is the most common petrel found in Cook Strait and northern South Island.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The breeding  season starts in March-April with the laying in May-June. 
    The Westland  Petrel nests in a burrow of 1-2 metres long, excavated by the birds with bill  and feet, but it may also use cavities, hollow logs or a cavity among tree  roots. The nest is usually made close to take-off points. There is some lining  in the nest chamber such as leaves, twigs, feathers and debris. 
    This species  breeds in colonies established along an 8 kilometres area of coastal forest in  the West Coast of the South Island.",,"The Westland  Petrel has currently fairly stable population of about 10,700 mature  individuals. The species is threatened by introduced predators, but also by the  native Weka which takes eggs and  chicks and may kill adults. 
    Human activities  such as mining and agriculture have destroyed areas of suitable habitat. As partially  nocturnal species, the birds are attracted by lights and are killed by flying  into power pylons. They are vulnerable to fishing nets while following  trawlers. In addition, they have restricted breeding range in New Zealand. 
    The Westland  Petrel is currently listed as Vulnerable. In New Zealand, it is considered Naturally  Uncommon by the NZ threat classification.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellaria parkinsoni
Procallariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The first  illustration of the Black Petrel was made by Sydney Parkinson during the James  Cook’s first trip to the Pacific in 1768. This species was first seen off the  New Zealand coasts. French, English and scientific names pay tribute to this  artist. 
    This petrel  is the smallest species of genus Procellaria. Often solitary at sea, it may  feed in small groups associated with marine mammals.  
    The small  population appears currently stable, but the species has restricted breeding  range and is threatened by the usual introduced predators. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  46 cm
    Wingspan:  112-123 cm
    Weight:  700 g
The adult  has sooty-black plumage with slightly darker head and neck. 
    On the  underwing, coverts and bases of primary flight feathers are paler and greyer. 
    The bill  is pale yellowish with greyer culmen and tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and  webbed feet are blackish. 
Both sexes  are similar, although the male has slightly larger wings and bill than female. 
    The juvenile  resembles adults with less yellowish bill, mostly tinged greyish, bluish or  pink.
The  Black Petrel is smaller and more slender than the White-chinned Petrel (P. aequinoctialis), and very similar to the Westland Petrel (P. westlandica),  although the Black Petrel has slightly smaller bill and narrower wings.","The  Black Petrel breeds on Great Barrier Island and Little Barrier Island in the  Hauraki Gulf, Auckland, off NE North Island, New Zealand. 
    It spends  the breeding season around New Zealand, eastern Australia and the Pacific islands.  After breeding, it migrates to the South American waters and can be seen off  Ecuador. But this species is also reported off Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala,  Mexico and Galapagos Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The breeding  season starts in October, with petrels preparing the nesting period. The laying  occurs between mid-November and late January. The season lasts until July. 
    The  Black Petrel nests in colonies. They excavate the burrow of 1-3 metres long,  but they also may nest in cavities, among tree roots or in hollow logs. There is  a sparse lining in the nest chamber.",,"The  Black Petrel has been extirpated from mainland New Zealand by introduced  mammalian predators. The colony of the Little Barrier Island is legally protected,  and this predator-free island has restricted access. However, these predators  are present on Great Barrier Island at the main colony on Mount Hobson summit area.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Grey  Petrel has circumpolar distribution and occurs on several subantarctic islands  during the breeding season. Like other petrels, it breeds in colonies and nests  in burrows. It is marine and pelagic, and returns to islands only for breeding. 
    It forages  in the open sea by diving, and can reach depths of 10 metres. It uses its wings  for swimming underwater. It is attracted by fishing boats where it is  threatened by baited fish hooks. 
    Mammal predators  on breeding islands are responsible for declines, and this species is currently  listed as Near Threatened.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:
    Length:  48-50 cm
    Wingspan:  115-130 cm
    Weight:  760-1520 g
The adult  is a heavy-bodied seabird with narrow, long wings and ashy-grey plumage above  and white below. 
    The head  is dark grey to brownish-grey, but nape and upperparts are paler, slightly  darker on the upperwing, and even more on the tail. The upperparts show  slightly scaled pattern at close range.
    On the  underparts, the underwing is dark grey to brownish-grey, including the  axillaries. The wedge-shaped tail is grey. Rest of underparts is whitish, but  thighs and undertail-coverts may show some brownish-grey tinge. 
The head  may appear hooded sometimes, according to the distance and the light. 
    The stout  bill varies from greenish to yellowish or grey, but it is mostly ivory with blackish  culmen. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are fleshy-grey, darker  outside and with yellowish webs. 
Male and  female have similar plumage, but the male is slightly larger overall. 
    The juvenile  resembles adults.","The Grey  Petrel is found in temperate to subantarctic waters in S oceans. It breeds on  several islands including Tristan da Cunha, Gough, Marion, Crozet and Kerguelen  Islands, and E through S Indian Ocean to Campbell Island and Antipodes Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season starts in February/March and the laying takes place in March/April, 45  days after the birds returned to the colonies. 
    The Grey  Petrel establishes the colonies on steep, well-vegetated and well-drained  slopes. It nests in self-excavated burrows of 1-3 metres long.",,"The breeding  success depends on mammal predators on breeding islands, because cats and rats  are still present on some islands. 
    At Kerguelen,  the Grey Petrel is affected by predation and competition for nest-sites with  the Black-faced Sheathbill and the White-headed Petrel.  
    Both Antipodes  and Campbell Islands are legally protected as sanctuaries with restricted  access. The Grey Petrel is recognized at high risk from commercial fishing  operations. 
    The total  population is estimated at 400,000 individuals, but this figure could be  incorrect. Another tally estimates at least 80,000 pairs worldwide, but this is  probably a rough estimate.  
    The Grey  Petrel is currently listed as Near Threatened.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    It can  be seen occasionally around Australia and New Zealand.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The adults  usually gather near colonies in September, and by October, about two months  before the egg-laying, the mated pairs are together in their burrow. 
    The burrow  is often more than 2 metres long, with sparse lining of grass on the ground. It  is dug by the birds themselves with bill and feet. Their nesting habits make  them very vulnerable to introduced predators, and in addition, they compete  with rabbits for nesting burrows.",,"The Pink-footed  Shearwater has very restricted breeding range on three islands where predation  by introduced rats and coatis on Robinson Crusoe Island, and cats and dogs on  Mocha Island, are a major threat. In addition, about 20% of the chicks are  harvested by islanders on Mocha every year. 
    They are  affected by habitat degradation on Robinson Crusoe Island, due to soil erosion  by cattle, goats and rabbits, involving destruction of the burrows. 
    At sea,  the shearwaters are entangled in fishing gear and threatened by longline commercial  fishing activities in their wintering range.  
    Oil pollution,  chemical pollutants (mercury) and plastic debris are important threats too.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Procellariiformes Order – Procellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Little  Shearwater is the smallest species of all shearwaters with a length of 28  centimetres. Formerly, this species had several subspecies spread over the wide  range, but now, only five subspecies are recognized. 
    It is fairly  sedentary and more aquatic in its feeding behaviour, involving short, broad wings  and stocky body. 
    The Little  Shearwater is threatened by introduced mammal predators on the breeding grounds,  but today, several islands are predator-free. Degradation of the habitat and human  disturbance, with in addition erosion of sand dunes that destroy the nesting  burrows, make the species at risk in some parts of the range. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:
    Length:  28 cm (25-30 cm)
    Wingspan:  58-67 cm
    Weight:  140-275 g
The adult  of nominate race has dark, almost black upperparts, including head, upperwing  and tail. The hindneck may appear paler. 
    The underparts  are white but we can see a narrow black margin on the underwing. The white of  the underparts extends upwards to the sides of the rump. 
    On the  head, face and narrow supercilium are white, whereas the eye’s area shows dark  spotting in front of the eye and on the upper ear-coverts. The sides of lower  neck and upper breast are dark grey with some white flecking. 
    The bill  is blackish with blue-grey base. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet  are bluish with some blackish on the outer side of the tarsus and outer toe,  and mostly pinkish webs. 
    Male and  female are similar, but the female has shorter tail. 
    The juvenile  resembles adults.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The Little  Shearwater has five subspecies recognized.
P.a. tunneyi occurs in S Australian seas, and breeds on  islands off SW Australia. This race is especially small but resembles nominate.
P.a. assimilis (described above) is found in Tasman Sea, and breeds  on Lord Howe and Norfolk islands. 
P.a. elegans (displayed) or Subantarctic Little Shearwater  breeds in Tristan da Cunha group and Gough Island (Atlantic), and on Chatham  and Antipodes Islands (Pacific). There is possibly an unknown Chilean breeding  population off Chile.
    This race  is larger than nominate, with more or less scaly blackish upperparts. On the  head, the white supercilium is absent, and the face is dark, extending below  the eye. The underwing is white with narrow, dark trailing edge. 
P.a. kermadecensis occurs on Kermadec Islands and adjacent seas.  
P.a. haurakiensis is found in New Zealand seas S to Cook Strait.  It breeds on islands off NE North Island (NZ).
    The two  latter races resemble “elegans” but  with slightly different face pattern.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season takes place during the local summer and varies according to the range. The  birds perform a pre-laying exodus of about one month. They are colonial nesters  and can be affected by competition for nesting sites with other seabirds.  
    The nest  is a self-excavated burrow of 30 to 200 centimetres long, a fragile  construction dug into very friable soil. The burrow is lined with sparse  materials. It is found in coastal forest, scrub or tussac grass, on grassy  slopes or within forest. 
    The Little  Shearwater may also nest in rock crevices or among boulders, depending on  nest-site availability.",,"The Little  Shearwater is threatened by introduced predators (cats, rats and mice), and  human disturbance, both involving declines of the population and even local extinctions.
    The burrows  are very fragile when dug in friable soil where they can be crushed by people  walking within the breeding colonies. Degradation of the breeding habitat by  erosion of the sand dunes is another problem. Cessation of human exploitation  for eggs and meat is also recommended, because this species is becoming rare in  some places. 
    However,  eradication of Pacific rats from several breeding islands in New Zealand allows  a conservation ranking of Recovering. 
    The population  is estimated to number 300,000/750,000 individuals and decreasing. But currently,  the Little Shearwater is still evaluated as Least Concern.

HABITAT: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds in colonies established near the sea on flat or gently sloped  tundra, or on slopes covered with tussock grass. It nests in self-excavated  burrow. 
    Outside the  breeding season, it is marine and pelagic, and occurs mainly in cold waters. 
CALLS AND SONGS: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel is usually silent at sea where it is often solitary. At colonies, this  species is relatively quiet, only giving wheezy “chee-chee-chay” while flying  over the burrows. Some higher-pitched, more drawn-our sounds can be heard too.
BEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: 
    The Kerguelen  Petrel feeds mainly on squid (Gonatus antarcticus), some fish and crustaceans,  especially krill of genus Euphausia, and cephalopods. 
    Squid is  caught at night by surface-seizing, but it also performs dipping and surface-plunging.  It may associate with cetaceans that lead the preys close to the surface.
It is  usually solitary at sea, but it may take part to exuberant chases if numerous seabirds  are present. However, small groups of 4-5 birds congregate at food sources. It shows  little interest in ships. 
    When feeding  in open waters around Antarctica, it can be seen with Cape Petrel, Blue Petrel and Antarctic Prion.   
The Kerguelen  Petrel is nocturnal at colonies, although it may sometimes visit them by day. They  are monogamous. They breed in colonies and only defend the burrow. The laying occurs  in October, after a pre-laying exodus of four weeks in September. 
The Kerguelen  Petrel adults may visit the colonies all year round. They frequent subantarctic  and Antarctic waters S to pack ice throughout the year. 
    It disperses  widely S through Southern Ocean N to 40°S, sometimes to South Africa, Australia  and New Zealand. It may occasionally disperse as far as the Falklands and South  Georgia. 
The Kerguelen  Petrel performs a spectacular fast flight in strong winds, often in high  sweeping arcs and long glides. It may hover in Falco-like fashion at 20-30  metres above the water. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
    The breeding  season takes place between August and January/February, with the egg-laying in  October.   
    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds colonially on tussock-covered slopes with soft, wet soil in which  it digs the long burrow (0,80-2,80 metres) lined with vegetation. The entrance is  sheltered by tussock grass from strong winds. 
The female  lays a single white egg. The incubation lasts 46-51 days, shared by both adults  in long stints of 10-15 days. 
    At hatching,  the chick is covered with sooty-brown down. It is brooded for the first two  days. Both parents feed it and it fledges about 59-62 days after hatching.

INTRODUCTION:
    The  White-headed Petrel is a member of Pterodroma genus which includes the seabirds  known as “gadfly petrels”. This name is related to the high soaring flight at  sea performed by these birds. 
    This  species has distant feeding grounds and this flight allow it to travel long  distances from land. It is strictly nocturnal when breeding, in order to avoid  predation by the Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus). 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  40-46 cm
    Wingspan:  109 cm
    Weight:  580-800 g
The  adult is grey and white. The upperparts are pale grey, with darker grey  upperwing. Head, rump and tail are whitish. 
    The  underparts are white, contrasting with the dark underwing. 
    The head  is white with conspicuous dark eye patch and partial grey collar. 
    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pinkish-white with  black patches on toes. 
    Both  sexes are similar, and the juvenile resembles adults.","The  White-headed Petrel breeds in New Zealand region on several sub Antarctic  islands such as Kerguelen, Crozet, Macquarie, Auckland and Antipodes Islands. It  may breed too on Campbell, Marion and Prince Edward Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The  breeding season takes place from August to June.

Procellariiformes Order – Porcellariidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Great-winged  Petrel is now a monotypic species, but it was recently still treated as  conspecific with P. gouldi (Grey-faced Petrel). 
    This dark  petrel is highly pelagic and comes ashore only for breeding. It breeds on  subantarctic and Antarctic islands where it nests in burrows. 
    This species  is affected by illegal harvesting at colonies, and by mammalian predators  introduced to the islands, although several breeding islands are today  predator-free. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  38-40 cm
    Wingspan:  97-100 cm
    Weight:  385-680 g
The Great-winged  Petrel adult is fairly large. It has dark plumage overall, mostly sooty brown  with variable paler and greyer area at base of bill.
    The underwing  appears uniformly dark, but according to the light, the greater coverts are  paler and greyer, and a slightly silvery patch is visible at base of primaries. 
    The wings  are long and pointed. The tail is wedge-shaped. 
On the  dark head, the bill is black with hooked tip. The eyes are blackish-brown. Legs  and webbed feet are black. 
Male and  female are similar.
    The juvenile  has a pale grey area around the bill and mostly black plumage at fledging.","The Great-winged  Petrel is found in Southern Ocean off W Australia and N New Zealand. It breeds  on Tristan da Cunha and Gough, Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen and Amsterdam Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The Great-winged  Petrel breeds in winter. The birds return to the colonies in late  January/February, and perform a pre-laying exodus during several days. It may  nest solitary or in loose colonies where they have strictly nocturnal habits. 
    It excavates  the burrow of 60 to 290 centimetres long, but they also use rock crevices when  available, or the nest-site is established under the vegetation or in the  shelter of tree roots. The nest is lined with leaves and twigs.",,"The Great-winged  Petrel is fairly widespread but it is affected by introduced predators on its breeding  islands, threatened by longline trawlers and illegal harvesting at some  colonies. However, some breeding islands are today predator-free. 
    The population  is suspected to be declining. The global population is estimated at 500,000  breeding pairs and 1,500,000 individuals across the wide range.
    Despite these  threats, the Great-winged Petrel is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

It breeds on islands, often on steep slopes with dense tussock grass. The  breeding colonies are usually established in coastal areas, but also well  inland.","lecanoides urinatrix
Procellariiformes Order – Pelecanoididae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The diving-petrel’s  taxonomy is still a matter of some debate, and depending on the authors, these  birds can be placed in the family Procellariidae or in the family Pelecanoididae  (like on this page). There are four species of small, stocky seabirds highly  adapted to the aquatic life. 
    The Common  Diving-Petrel has the widest range, but it is threatened by introduced and  invasive species on the breeding islands where it nests in burrows.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics: 
    Length:  20-25 cm
    Wingspan:  33-38 cm
    Weight:  86-185 g
The adult  is very similar to the Little Auk or  Dovekie (Alle alle) of the Northern Hemisphere. But there is any relation  between the two families. 
    The upperparts,  including upperwing and uppertail, are grey-black. The short, rounded wings are  browner, especially on primaries. In fresh plumage, the rectrices have whitish  tips. 
  The underparts  are dusky white with grey underwing, mostly dark grey on axillaries and  marginal coverts. The undertail is grey. There are some grey spots on body  sides and rear flanks. 
On the  head, we can see a blackish-grey mask through the eyes and on anterior  ear-coverts. Supercilium and neck-sides are dull white. There is a large grey  to dark grey patch on breast-sides, sometimes forming a complete collar.   
The short,  broad-based, hooked bill is blackish-grey, but the lower mandible has paler  base and pale horn spot at centre. It is formed by several horny plates. The two  external tubular nostrils are open upwards (forwards in other petrels) as an  adaptation for diving. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pale  blue with blackish webs and soles.","CIES AND RANGE:
    The Common  Diving-Petrel has six recognized subspecies.
P.u. urinatrix (here described) occurs in SW Pacific Ocean  and Tasman Sea. It breeds from SE Australia and Tasmania to N New Zealand, including the Cook Strait.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season varies according to the range, but it occurs in July in the northernmost  parts, and until late December in the southernmost parts of the range. The Common  Diving-Petrel is away from the colonies only for 1-2 months. 
    It breeds  in colonies and nests in burrows excavated in soft soil under rocks protected  by dense tussock grass, or in rock crevices. The burrow of 25-150 centimetres  long is usually unlined, but sometimes, some feathers, grass or pebbles are added.",,"The Common  Diving-Petrel is threatened by introduced and invasive predators on the  breeding islands, such as feral cats and rats. On the other hand, cattle, sheep  and rabbits destroy the habitat in the breeding grounds. 
    The population  was estimated at 16,000,000 individuals in 2004. 
    This species  has wide range and in spite of possible decline, the Common Diving-Petrel is currently  evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    Adult has dark grey to blackish upperparts, including  tail and flippers.
    Underparts are mainly white, but upper breast is  orange-yellow bordered with black stripe on sides, becoming paler towards the  lower breast. The under flippers is white, with conspicuous black tips.

It  catches its preys by pursuit-diving, and can remain underwater during 15  minutes and more, diving from 150 to 200-300 metres depth. King  Penguin has often to travel hundreds of kilometres to find food.","King Penguin populations are stable or increasing, and  they are not globally threatened at this moment. 
King Penguin is preyed upon by Leopard seals and  Killer Whales which kill adults and great shorebirds such as skuas, sheathbills  and giant petrels which take eggs and attack the chicks.

    The  Emperor Penguin is an offshore feeder and forages in the cold Antarctic waters.","tes forsteri
Sphenisciforme Order – Spheniscidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Emperor Penguin is the largest species of this family. It lives in very harsh  environment on the Antarctic ice, and forages in the surrounding cold waters.  This inhospitable habitat involves first physical adaptations, and then  co-operative behaviours, in order to survive, feed and breed in such extreme  conditions.  
    This  amazing bird has beautiful appearance as well as chick as adult. They spend all  the year between Antarctic ice and nearby waters. They are living on frozen  sea-ice where they breed in colonies.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  112-115 cm
    Weight:  M: 35-45 kg – F: 28-32 kg
The  adult has blue-grey upperparts and flippers, and black head and tail. 
    The  underparts are white, bordered by black band along the dark upperparts. 
    On the  head, there are deep yellow-orange ear patches on each side of the head, fading  and turning pale yellow to white down neck and upper breast. Head, chin and  throat are black.
    The bill  shows black upper mandible and pink to orange lower mandible. The eyes are  black. Legs and webbed feet are black with sharp black claws. 
Both  sexes are similar, with male slightly larger than female.
    The  immature resembles adults but ear-patches, chin and throat are white. 
    The  chick has silvery-grey down. The head is black with white eye area and cheeks.","The  Emperor Penguin is circumpolar and restricted to Antarctica. The breeding  colonies occur on the ice around the Antarctic continent, the Antarctic  Peninsula and the adjacent islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    They  arrive at colony in March/April, when the sunlight is decreasing. The laying  occurs in May/June. The Emperor Penguin is colonial but not territorial. They  do not build nest. 
    The  female lays a single egg which is transferred to the male, while the female  goes out to sea for feeding during two months. The male incubates the egg  during 35 days, by holding it on its feet against the brood patch. The  incubating males huddle together to avoid cold and wind. The male loses half of  its body weight during the incubation period.",,"The  Emperor Penguin will be threatened in the future by climate change involving  decrease in sea-ice concentration and thickness, and also by climatic weather  variations. Human disturbances in some areas, with the proximity of scientific  bases and aircrafts’ movements, are an important threat for colonies. 
    There  are 46 colonies with 238 000 breeding pairs (2012). 
    The  chicks on land are preyed upon by Giant Petrels. The adults are attacked at sea  by Leopard sea-lions, but immature and weak penguins are the most usual preys. 
    Currently,  the Emperor Penguin is listed as Near Threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions -  ISBN: 8487334105

It avoids ice, and frequents bare hillsides and beaches.  It spends most of time fishing at sea.","CRIPTION: 
    Gentoo Penguin is the largest penguin after Emperor and King Penguins.","Gentoo Penguin lives in Antarctica and  sub-Antarctica islands. It breeds mainly on the Kerguelen Islands, on South  Georgia and in Falklands.","Gentoo Penguin does not fly, but it walks and even runs on the ground  and in spite of its clumsy attitude, it runs easily on land.
But Gentoo Penguin is made for swimming. It can dive at 20 to 200 metres depth. It can  swim rapidly underwater, and it is the fastest swimming bird, reaching speeds  of 35 km  per hour.","Breeding season occurs from spring to autumn, but variation is  considerable with the locality. Gentoo Penguin breeds in small colonies,  sometimes with other species. These colonies can move from year to year, and  penguins breed at some distance from the last year, at about 150 metres. This  behaviour could be a kind of defence against parasites, or a way for allowing  the vegetation to grow again. Such numbers of birds leave heavy accumulation of  excreta.","Gentoo Penguin feeds mainly on krill, but also on fish and squid. It  catches its preys by diving underwater and pursuit. Gentoo Penguin dives deeper  than other species, avoiding competition for food resources. It swallows the  prey head first, and while swimming.","Gentoo Penguin has a wide range, but this species has suffered from  human threats and habitat loss over the last century. Populations seem to be  more stable at this moment, thanks to conservation efforts. 
    Gentoo Penguin, as other species, is preyed upon by skuas, falcons,  gulls, petrels and feral cats which take the eggs and attack the chicks.  
    Adults are taken by Leopard seals, and nests are destroyed by Elephant  seals when they move through the colony.  
    An estimate (Lynch 2012) suggests an increase of the population,  especially in the south of the range. The global population is estimated to  number 387,000 pairs (314,000 pairs in 1993). 
  But currently, the Gentoo Penguin is classified as Near Threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del  Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:   
    The name  of the Adelie Penguin pays tribute to Adelie d’Urville, the wife of the French  polar explorer Dumont d’Urville (1790-1842). 
    The Adelie  Penguins are living in the southernmost coldest parts of the range, and this  anomalous distribution could have originated from their peculiar diet. This species  feeds mostly on small krill of order Euphausiacea,  and has been recorded occasionally at depths of 175 metres. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  69-71 cm
    Weight:  3600-4500 g
The medium-sized  adult has black head, upperparts, flippers and long, wedge-shaped tail. The underparts  are white, except the pale pink under flippers. 
    The bill  is pinkish with black culmen, cutting edges and tip. The base is well feathered,  covered with short black feathers. The eyes are dark, surrounded by conspicuous  white eyering. Short legs and webbed feet are pink with black claws. 
    Both sexes  are similar.
    The juvenile  has white throat and chin, and black eyering.","The Adelie  Penguin has circumpolar distribution, and is common along the entire Antarctic  coast.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    They arrive  at colonies in September/October, and the laying usually occurs in November. 
    They breed  colonially and may form huge aggregations, usually in discrete areas. Nests are  very close to each other.
    The nest  is a shallow depression on the ground, lined with pebbles, slightly higher than  the surrounding area. The male arrives first and starts the nest building. Later,  after some displays and recognition, both mates build the nest. 
    These penguins  are known to steal stones from other nests.",,"The Adelie  Penguin is preyed upon by leopard seals, killer whales and South Polar Skuas. 
    In spite  of large numbers, this species is vulnerable to climate change, especially with  decreases in sea ice concentration. Colonies are disturbed by human activities  such as installation of scientific stations, involving reduction of suitable  breeding grounds, frequent visits to colonies, and helicopters flying overhead. 
    Decreases  begin to be reported in some areas, and the Adelie Penguin is currently  evaluated as Near Threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Fiordland  Penguin is endemic to New Zealand and breeds in the coastal rainforest. It is  closely related to the Snares Penguin but some physical and behavioural differences are reported. 
    The Fiordland  Penguin is very shy and mainly active during the night when on land. Outside the  breeding season, it is found in the open ocean and shows solitary lifestyle. 
    This species  has small populations (5000-6000 mature birds) and restricted range, and is  currently listed as Vulnerable.  
    This species  is also known as Fiordland Crested Penguin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:

The adult  has blue-black upperparts, flippers, tail and head, including chin and throat. 
    The underparts  are white. Flipper underside is pale pink with black edges and tip. 
    This species  differs from the Snares Penguin by  white markings or stripes on cheeks, shorter yellow crest and absence of pale  pink bare skin around the bill base. 
    The yellow  band starts from the base of the bill and extends over the eye, and droops down  the rear of the head. 
    The red-orange  bill is relatively short. The eyes are deep red. Legs and webbed feet are pale  pink with black claws.","The Fiordland  Penguin is found in the Fiordland region, from SW coast of South Island in New  Zealand, to the nearby islands of Stewart and Solander. It can be occasionally  seen in Tasmania and along the SE coast of Australia, but not for breeding.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The Fiordland  Penguin arrives at colony in June-July, and the laying occurs in July-August. 
    It may  nest solitary or in small loose colonies. The nesting areas are in coastal  rainforest, often along the west coasts of New Zealand. The nest is placed in  natural hollow, under bushes or overhanging rocks, or between tree roots. The nest  is made with very little material and is lined with sticks and some plant  material often collected by the male. In soft soil, the nest can be excavated with  the feet, or by rotation of the belly. Fidelity to nest-sites is reported.",,"The Fiordland  Penguin is threatened by introduced predators such as stoats, ferrets, rats,  cats and dogs which kill the chicks. Human disturbance also reduces the  breeding success. Some human developments (roads) may lead to the loss of some  nesting sites. Nest failure can also be caused by heavy rainfall. 
    This species  is currently listed as Vulnerable.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Erect-crested Penguin is one of the largest penguins of genus Eudyptes. Its  funny appearance with the yellow erect eyebrows makes this species different on  land. However, at sea with wet drooping feathers, it can be easily confused  with Fiordland Penguin and Snares Penguin. 
    It is  also called Sclater’s Penguin, after the English zoologist Philip Lutley  Sclater (1829-1913). 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  63-68 cm
    Weight:  5400-6500 g
The  adult has blue-black upperparts and white underparts. Flippers are blue-black  too, with white trailing edge. The underside is white with black tip. 
    The head  is much darker, usually black. We can see a broad yellow stripe starting above  the lore and extending over the eye and forming an erect crest. 
    The bill  is brownish-red and fairly long. There is a pinkish-white edge along the lower  mandible and the gape. The eyes are deep red. Legs and webbed feet are pale  pink with black claws.","The  Erect-crested Penguin breeds mainly on Bounty and Antipodes Islands, but small  numbers are breeding on Auckland and Campbell islands too. 
    This  species occurs in islands to S and SE of New Zealand.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The  Erect-crested Penguin arrives at colony in September, and the laying starts in  October. 
    They  breed in large colonies, often with the Southern  Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome). The male arrives first and  returns close to the usual nest-site. The female returns two weeks later. Some  displays and fights occur at this period.
    The nest  is often placed on flat rocky ground, about 70-75 metres above the sea-level.  The nest is a shallow depression with a rim made with rocks and mud. The  depression is lined with some grass when available. Both sexes take part in  nest-building.",,"The  Erect-crested Penguin has the usual predators such as skuas and seals. Populations decline probably due to climate  changes and marine factors which affect this species by reduction of preys.
    All  islands are nature reserves, protecting the penguins from human disturbances.  However, this species has very restricted range, and is currently classified as  Endangered.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions  - ISBN: 8487334105

Sphenisciforme Order – Spheniscidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Royal  Penguin is very similar to the Macaroni  Penguin (E. chrysolophus). Both species were formerly considered to be the  same species. The Royal Penguin is the largest member of genus Eudyptes. 
    Both scientific  and French names pay tribute to the German zoologist Hermann Schlegel  (1804-1884). 
    Populations  have increased through the 20th century, but this species has very  restricted range on some islands, and is classified as Vulnerable. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  70-76 cm
    Weight:  4500-5000 g
The adult  has blue-black upperparts and flippers, and white underparts. The underside of  flippers is white with black leading edge and tip. Unlike the Macaroni  Penguin, it has white face,  chin and throat.
    On the  head, the crest is orange-yellow and black, and formed by elongated feathers. The  eye area is grey and the ear-coverts are white. 
    The red-orange  bill is large and heavy, with pink gape and yellow wash below the lower  mandible and on lores. The eyes are deep red. Legs and webbed feet are pale  pink with black claws.","The Royal  Penguin occurs on the sub-Antarctic islands, S to New Zealand, and breeds on  Macquarie Island and adjacent islets.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The laying  takes place in October.
    The Royal  Penguin breeds colonially with thousands of birds. Colonies are usually located  as far as two kilometres inland, and about 200 metres above the sea-level. 
    The nest  is a shallow depression in stones or sand. It is made with small stones and  often lined with grass or other available plant materials.",,"The Royal  Penguin breeding success can be reduced by human disturbances and tourists. Pollution,  especially ingested plastics, may kill the birds. But climate change affects  the temperature of the sea surface and reduces the numbers of preys.

Sphenisciforme Order – Spheniscidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The  Little Penguin is the smallest species of this family. Unlike most of the other  penguins, this species lives and breeds in burrows or natural holes, and spends  the day out at sea, alone or in small groups. 
    This  species is also named Fairy Penguin, Little Blue Penguin or Blue Penguin, from  its small size and its slate-blue plumage.
    The  Little Penguin has several subspecies, and among them, the White-flippered Penguin  (E.m. albosignata) is sometimes considered a full species. But currently, it is  considered a colour morph or a subspecies of the Little Penguin since 2012.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:  
    Length:  40-45 cm
    Weight:  1000 g
The  adult resembles juveniles of genus Spheniscus, with short, stocky body. It has pale  blue to slate-blue upperparts, depending on the season and the age. 
The  underparts are white, with indistinct transition between upperparts and  underparts, from grey to brown, mainly visible in the face. The flippers are  bluish above and white below. 
The head  is like the upperparts, with slate-grey ear-coverts fading to white below. 
The bill  is dark blackish-grey, and is about 3-4 centimetres long. The eyes are bluish-grey  or pale grey. Legs and webbed feet are pink, with black soles and webbing.","CIES AND RANGE:  
    The  Little Penguin has six subspecies spread along the coasts of Australia,  Tasmania and New Zealand. 
E.m. minor (here described) is found in W and S South  island and Stewart Island. 
E.m. novaehollandiae is found in S Australia and  Tasmania. 
E.m. iredalei from N North Island.
E.m. variabilis from S North Island and Cook Strait. 
E.m. chathamensis from Chatham Island. This race is very similar to nominate, but the eyes are mostly dark grey or brown.  
E.m. albosignata (here displayed too) from E South Island. This  one has white leading and trailing edges on flippers. This subspecies is  evaluated as Endangered.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:   
    The  Little Penguin can breed in all months, but the season may vary according to  the location and the year. 
    They  nest colonially, but single breeding pairs can be common. Within the colony, the  nests are close to each other. The nest is a burrow dug in sand, but the Little  Penguin may also nest in caves, rock crevices, under vegetation and even under  human constructions. They usually breed on offshore islands, or along the  mainland coast, in areas inaccessible to predators.",,"The  Little Penguin’s populations are declining, often due to introduced predators,  decrease of numbers of preys and oil pollution. Their breeding habitats are  affected by coastal erosion, human developments and pollution. 
    However,  the Little Penguin is not currently threatened, but the subspecies  “albosignata” is considered as Endangered with restricted range.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

    On the ground, it walks in standing up posture, with  small steps due to the short legs. It moves slowly with open flippers used to  keep the balance. When the nest is higher on slopes, the male descends by  walking or gliding backwards.","The Magellanic Penguin arrives at colony in  August-September, and the laying occurs in September-October.
    Adults establish the nest-site within the loose  colony. They excavate the burrow which will provide them protection from  excessive heat and predators.","The Magellanic Penguin feeds on fish, mainly anchovies  (Engraulis ringens), squid and crustaceans. It swims underwater, catches the  prey and swallows it head first. They perform co-operative feeding at shoals.","The Magellanic Penguin’s populations are abundant, but  several threats such as egg-collecting, habitat degradation with destruction of  burrows, oil pollution, increase of commercial fishing and disturbances at  colonies, involved marked decline.

Suliformes Order – Fregatidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Lesser  Frigatebird is the smallest member of the family Fregatidae. It was formerly  placed in the genus “Apagen” due to its small size. 
    Like numerous  bird species, it is threatened by habitat destruction, disturbance, and  persecution for food by humans. Three subspecies are recognized. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  66-81 cm
    Wingspan:  155-193 cm
    Weight:  M: 625-875 g – F: 760-955 g
The adult  male has brownish-black plumage overall. However, head, neck, mantle and  scapulars show blue, purple and greenish gloss. This species lacks the pale  upperwing panel.
    On the underparts,  we can see a white crescent over central axillaries and anterior flanks. 
    The long,  hooked bill is blackish-grey. The gular pouch is bright red and is inflated  during the courtship displays. The eyes are blackish-brown, surrounded by  narrow, bare, dark eyering. Legs and feet are pinkish-red.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    Three subspecies  are currently recognized. They are mainly based on measurements.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The breeding  season can occur throughout the year with the laying mainly in dry season. 
    The Lesser  Frigatebird is a colonial nester and may form groups of up to 100 nests, often  with other species such as the Great  Frigatebird.     
    The nest  is built by the pair, with the male providing nest materials to the female  which builds the nest. This is a stick platform placed in tree, up to 15 metres  above the ground.",,"The Lesser  Frigatebird is not globally threatened. In spite of the usual threats such as habitat  destruction, disturbance and human persecution for food, this species has large  populations, probably several hundred thousand birds.

    This species  breeds in the low, dry forest of the island, mostly in the outer part, in tall  trees such as Indian Almond trees (Terminalia catappa) and Ficus.","egata andrewsi
Suliformes Order – Fregatidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Christmas  Frigatebird has small breeding range on Christmas Island, in E Indian Ocean. This  species is listed as Critically Endangered due to low breeding success and long  breeding cycle, small and decreasing population, clearing of rainforest for  phosphate mining, introduced Yellow crazy ants, cats and rats. These are the  main threats which affect this bird. 
    Outside the  breeding season, the Christmas Frigatebird disperses widely at sea, N to near  the Philippines, and is exposed to hunting, entanglement in fishing nets and  marine pollution. 
    This spectacular  large seabird is well-adapted to this robust ecological role, but it may be so  fragile in other traits. Like numerous island bird species, the Christmas Frigatebird  is affected by human presence and its following consequences. Conservation  strategies are needed. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:  
    Length:  89-100 cm
    Wingspan:  205-230 cm
    Weight:  M: 1400 g – F: 1550 g 
The adult  has black plumage, deeply forked tail and long, hooked bill. 
    The adult  male has blackish-brown plumage overall, with green to bluish-green gloss on  the blacker head, and on neck, mantle and scapulars. On the upperwing, there is  a broad, pale brownish diagonal panel formed by paler secondary coverts. The forked  tail is blackish. 
    On the underparts,  we can see a conspicuous white patch on belly, but it does not reach vent or  axillaries, although some males may show some few white feathers on outer  axillary area. 
The head  is black with red gular pouch becoming inflated during the breeding season, but  much duller and reduced outside breeding.
    The long,  hooked bill is bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown, surrounded by narrow  blackish eyering. Legs and feet are slaty grey.","The Christmas  Frigatebird breeds only on Christmas Island in E Indian Ocean, and forages in  the surrounding waters. Outside the breeding season, it disperses widely  throughout Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. This species is occasionally  seen near Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, the Andaman Islands and the Keeling  islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The pair  is usually formed by end February, and the laying occurs mostly between March  and May. The Christmas Frigatebird breeds in small colonies of 10, 20 to 30  pairs in the same tree, usually sheltered from high winds for easier landing. 
    The nests  are placed under the top branches. It is a flimsy platform, built at 10-20  metres above the ground in tree fork, usually in Terminalia catappa and Celtis  timorensis, occasionally Ficus.",,"The Christmas  Frigatebird’s population declined following human settlement. In 2003, the  population was estimated at 2,400/4,800 mature individuals, equating to 3,600/7,200  individuals in total. There were 1171 nesting pairs in 2003. 
    Habitat destruction  and hunting, but also weather conditions and the introduced Yellow crazy ants  (Anoplolepis gracilipes) have a serious impact on the ecosystem.
    The Christmas  Frigatebird is currently considered as critically Endangered, with a population  still decreasing.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Suliformes Order – Sulidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Masked Booby is the largest species of the family Sulidae. It was described first by the French naturalist  René-Primevère Lesson, in 1831. 
    This  species is strictly marine and usually occurs over pelagic waters, preferring  deeper waters than other boobies. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  81-92 cm
    Wingspan:  152 cm
    Weight:  1450 g
The  adult has white plumage overall, except the brownish-black flight-feathers and  rectrices. However, the bases of remiges and central rectrices are  silvery-grey.
    On the  white head, the facial skin is black around the eyes, on the lores, and around  the bill base, extending down to chin and upper throat. The skin is less dark  on chin and lores. 
    The  thick, long bill is bright yellow in males, with variable olive wash. It can be  sometimes light horn with grey tinge at base. The eyes are golden yellow to  amber. Legs and webbed feet are yellow-orange, sometimes olive.","CIES AND RANGE:  
    The  Pacific races are larger than nominate, and vary in colour of bare parts. The  nominate race (here described) is the smallest, and there is an increasing  cline to the east. 
    The race  “granti” is the largest. The Nazca Booby (Sula granti) is now a full species.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The  breeding season depends on the range.
    The  Masked Booby nests in colonies established on the ground, near cliff ledge or  slope for easier take-off and landing. The nests are 2-3 metres apart, but  sometimes up to 100 metres. This is a shallow depression on the ground,  surrounded by a circle of pebbles, debris or accumulated excreta.",,"The  Masked Booby is fairly common in its range, but widely dispersed throughout  tropical waters, with an estimated population of several hundred thousand  individuals. 
    The race  “melanops” is declining rapidly, and the remaining birds are threatened. 
    The  breeding colonies are often subject to exploitation by humans who take the eggs  and kill the adults. Introduced predators and tourism development are important  threats too.
    But  currently, the Masked Booby is not globally threatened.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

INTRODUCTION:
    The Macquarie  Shag is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), but it is currently considered  a full species. It is very similar to other blue-eyed cormorants living  throughout the Sub Antarctic islands, but they have well separated ranges. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  71-75 cm
    Wingspan:  110 cm
    Weight:  2500-3500 g
The adult  has black hindneck and upperparts with blue gloss. Scapulars and upperwing show  more bronzy gloss. A white wingbar is formed by several lesser upperwing  secondary coverts. Flight feathers and greater coverts have brownish-silver  sheen. The tail is duller and blackish, with whitish shafts at base. It may  have some hair-like white filoplumes on head and upperparts. 
    The underparts  are white with blackish underwing, although the basal part of the leading edge  is white. The outer side of the thighs is black. 
The head  is black with greenish-blue gloss down to gape. Chin, throat and foreneck are  white. 
    During the  breeding season, there is a black crest on the forecrown, which is much reduced  or lost towards the end of this period. The white filoplumes are lost too, and  the plumage becomes duller. 
    The eyes  are dark greenish-brown, surrounded by blue, bare eyering. We can see  conspicuous yellow caruncles on sides of forehead, and smaller darker yellow caruncles  on the blackish background around the gape, at base of lower mandible.
    The bill  is blackish with horn-coloured tip. Legs and webbed feet are pink. 
    Outside the  breeding season, the caruncles are duller and reduced. The eyering is dull bluish.  The bill becomes brownish with pale tip. Legs and feet show dull brownish on  rear of tarsus, joints and webs.","The Macquarie  Shag is endemic to Macquarie Island, and also occurs on the nearby Bishop and  Clark islets, S of New Zealand.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The laying  occurs mainly in October/November. The colonies are sometimes alongside  penguins.  
    The nest  is a truncated cone made with tussock grass held together with mud and excreta.  It is placed on the ground, among boulders and near the high-tide line. There is  a strong competition for nest-sites, and males defend them actively. The nests  are 1-2 metres apart.",,"The Macquarie  Shag is a rare bird. The main causes of mortality are first, the predation by Brown Skua, the subspecies Stercorarius antarcticus lonnbergi, and then,  the effect of adverse weather involving nest destruction and restricted access  to preys. The storms may also destroy colonies and adults. 
    The Macquarie  Shag is currently listed as Vulnerable, with small population (less than 1000  mature individuals) and restricted range.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105

Suliformes Order – Phalacrocoracidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Kerguelen Shag is often considered  a subspecies of the Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), but it differs by its small size and shorter bill, more  rounded wings, all black upperparts (with no white on wings or back), dull brownish  legs and feet and bluish-grey eyering. 
    It is endemic to Kerguelen Islands  in S Indian Ocean. It breeds in colonies along the coasts of some islands of  the archipelago, and forages in open inshore waters. 
    The Kerguelen Shag is not globally  threatened but it has fairly small breeding range.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 65 cm
    Wingspan: 110 cm
    Weight: 1700-2240 g
The Kerguelen Shag adult has black  head, hindneck, upperparts (including wings and tail) and outer part of the  thighs, with blue gloss becoming mostly bronzy green on scapulars and  upperwing. 
    The underparts are white, including  chin, throat, lower cheeks and neck sides. The underwing is blackish with brownish  wash. 
    On the head, we can see a long,  erectile black crest formed by several up curved feathers on crown. The head is  black from crown to malar area, with greenish-blue gloss. 
During the breeding season, there  are some white filoplumes above and behind the eye. The crest is usually lost  as the breeding season progresses, like the filoplumes. The plumage becomes  duller too. 
    We can see conspicuous warty yellow  caruncles on the sides of the forehead. Gape, base of mandibles and gular pouch  are dark brown, and the bare skin is densely covered with numerous tiny yellow tubercles. 
    The eyes are dark brown, surrounded  by broad, blue eyering. The bill is dark grey with brown tinge and paler at  tip. Legs and webbed feet are pink with dark areas on joints and webs.  
Outside the breeding season, the caruncles  become smaller and dull orange-buff, and the eyering is duller. The facial skin  is paler and duller.    
    Male and female are similar. The Kerguelen  Shag resembles other “blue-eyed” shags but it is smaller.  
The juvenile has dark brown  upperparts and a variable amount of dark brown on the underparts. The eyes are  brown. The caruncles are absent. The facial skin is dull and legs and feet are brownish. 
    The immature has more glossy  plumage and gradually acquires the white underparts. 
RANGE:  
    The Kerguelen Shag is endemic to  the Kerguelen Islands in S Indian Ocean, one of the most remote areas on Earth.  It nests on the main island of the archipelago (Grande Terre), on some offshore  islands and on islands in the Golfe du Morbihan (Kerguelen), on the E coast of  Grande Terre. 
HABITAT: 
    The Kerguelen Shag nests on exposed  stretches along the coasts, but also in more sheltered areas. It forages at sea  throughout the islands of the archipelago, often in bays or inlets, usually  within six kilometres of the shore. During summer, if feeds among kelp. 
CALLS AND SOUNDS:
    The Kerguelen Shag male is more  vocal than the female, and usually makes croaking, groaning and growling. The female  produces softer hissing sounds. 
BEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: 
    The Kerguelen Shag feeds on fish  and aquatic invertebrates such as echinoderms, crustaceans and marine worms. Like  all Phalacrocoracidae, it feeds  mainly by pursuit-diving underwater. 
    During the breeding season, it  usually forages alone, but outside this period, they feed in large flocks,  forming linear flocks of several hundred individuals. 
    Some of them feed on introduced  brown trout (Salmo trutta) and brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis) in freshwater  lakes on Kerguelen.  
The Kerguelen Shag breeds in  colonies of 30 to 400 pairs, depending on the island. The male performs the  typical courtship displays such as “Gargling”. It throws its head back until the  nape touches the rump, while the bill is wide open. This display is accompanied  by calls. Both adults share the nesting duties. They are monogamous. 
The Kerguelen Shag is sedentary and  only disperses throughout the islands of the archipelago after the breeding  season. Some immature birds are recorded up to 80 kilometres from the islands,  over the continental shelf. But most colonies are often occupied year-round.  
    The Kerguelen Shag has powerful  flight with regular, continuous wingbeats, sometimes interspersed with glides. 
REPRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The egg laying period varies  depending on the colony. It usually occurs between September and January, with  peak in October/November. The colonies may include 30 to 400 pairs, and they  are sometimes established close to penguin colonies. 
    The nest is a truncated cone made  with grass and seaweeds, cemented together with mud and guano. It is generally  built on cliff ledge or in rock crevice. It can be reused in several following  years if not destroyed. 
The female lays 2-4 eggs and both  adults share the incubation during about one month. At hatching, the chicks are  naked, but a dark brown down growths very soon.  
    They are preyed upon by skuas, gulls and sheathbills,  in spite of heavy protection by their parents.  
PROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS:    
    The Kerguelen Shag is considered  fairly abundant throughout its restricted range. It is not globally threated  outside the natural predation. 
    The population is estimated at  12,000 pairs and appears to be stable. 
    The Kerguelen Shag is currently evaluated  as Least Concern.

The cup is about 20 cm depth, and is lined  with leaves and soft materials and also human refuse. The cup may also include  dried mud. The nest is reused during several years.","Brahminy Kite feeds on wide variety of small preys and  carrion. It hunts for mammals, birds, reptiles, aquatic animals taken with the  talons, crustaceans, amphibians, fish… It hawks flying insects and performs  piracy from fishing birds. 
    They gather around large carcasses where they  squeal.","Brahminy Kite is abundant and widespread in tropical  parts of the range, benefiting from human activities. 
    In Australia,  the DDT use and the disturbances threaten the species. In some parts of the  range, such as in Java and Thailand,  the species suffered decline due to pesticides, hunting and collection of  nestlings at nest for sale, and loss of breeding habitat.  
    However, the populations are not globally threatened  at this moment.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 2 by Josep  del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 8487334156

INTRODUCTION:
    The Swamp  Harrier is a typical “circus” species, formerly considered a race of the Western Marsh Harrier (Circus  aeruginosus). They are very similar in behaviour, and may appear fairly similar  in plumage in spite of different colours and pattern. 
    This raptor is often seen on exposed perch  on the roadside. It feeds both on carrion and live preys, and it is known for  its spectacular “sky-dancing displays”. This species is commonly seen gliding  above its habitat throughout New Zealand, but it is native, not an endemic bird  species. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  50-60 cm
    Wingspan:  118-145 cm
    Weight:  M: 650 g – F: 850 g
The adult  male has mainly dark brown upperparts with conspicuous white rump, well visible  in flight. Wings and tail are dark brown with darker bars on flight feathers  and rectrices.
    On the  underparts, the breast is creamy-white with brown streaks. Rest of underparts,  including belly, vent and undertail-coverts are whitish. The underwing is creamy-white  too with streaked coverts and barred brown flight feathers with dark tips. 
On the  brown head, we can see conspicuous facial disks giving this bird an owl-like  face mask. 
    The strongly  hooked bill is black with yellow cere. The eyes are yellow with pale yellow  eyering. Legs and feet are pale yellow.","The Swamp  Harrier occurs in S New Guinea, Melanesia, Australia, New Zealand and several islands  of the Southern Pacific. It is only a breeding visitor in Tasmania. 
    In New  Zealand, this raptor is present in a wider ecological niche than elsewhere in  Australasia, and it occurs from the Kermadec Islands in the far North, to the  cold subantarctic islands and the Chatham Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The laying  occurs between October and December.
    The nest is a  platform made with rushes and grasses, and lined with feathers. The Swamp Harrier nests on the ground in  swamps, scrub and tangled fern or wheat fields, among tall and dense vegetation.  The female builds the nest on the ground, and occasionally in low trees.",,"The Swamp  Harrier is partially protected but the species is controlled at some sites  where endangered bird species are living. And if the Swamp Harrier is a  predator of some introduced species, it is also a predator for other birds and  it takes poultry and game birds. It may occasionally kill new-born lambs too.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 2 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal  - Lynx Edicions -  ISBN: 8487334156

    Wedge-tailed eagle is found from sea level to  mountainous regions. It lives in woodlands and open countries, but it avoids  rainforest and coastal areas. It likes open woodland areas with good grassy  cover. It is uncommon in Australian deserts.
   
RANGE: 
    Wedge-tailed eagle lives mainly in Australia. We  can find small populations in Tasmania and Southern New Guinea.",,"Wedge-tailed eagle’s nest is very bulky. It is built  by both parents, in a place allowing a good view of the surrounding  countryside.  It may be located in dead  or live tall tree, or in small trees, shrubs, cliff faces, or even on the  ground. 
    Nest is made with dead wood sticks. It is a big  structure of almost 2   metres wide, 3 metres high and about 400 kg weight. On the top of  the nest, we find a shallow cup, lined with fresh twigs and leaves. 
    Between April and September, female lays 1 to 3 white  eggs, spotted and blotched with reddish-brown, at intervals of 2 to 4 days  between each egg. Incubation lasts about 42 to 48 days, beginning with the  first egg laid. Both parents share it. 
    First chick hatches larger than second and third.  Their lives depend on conditions, food resources and disturbances around the  nest site. 
    Usually, a pair keeps only one young, but in some good  years, we can see two chicks fledging in same nest. They fledge at about 70 to  95 days. 
    The oldest chick is larger than the other, and has  more chance to live. If food is not enough, it kills the smaller to eat. 
    Chicks are covered with white down. Both parents feed  them, first, giving them food to their mouths, and then, chicks can feed  themselves on the floor of the nest. 
    They reach the first feathers 10 to 15 days after  hatching. 
    If an intruder threats the young, it lies flat on the  floor of the nest, but it is able to defend itself, because parents do little  to defend it. 
  Juveniles and adults remain together during 11 to 12  weeks after fledging, and after this period, they move or disperse to other  places.","Wedge-tailed eagle feeds mainly on carrion. The most  important living preys are rabbits and hares. They also consume lizards, birds  and mammals. They kill sometimes lambs and young goats, but it is a small  percentage of their preys.","The small population of Tasmania is threatened by habitat  destruction and persecutions.  
    For the other populations, indirect poisoning and  pesticides are a major threat. 
    Wedge-tailed eagle is sensitive to forestry  operations, when extensive clearing reduce nesting resources.
    It is protected by the National Parks and Wildlife  Service. It is now illegal to kill, trap, poison or interfere with them in any  way.
    Wedge-tailed eagle is the emblem of Australia’s Northern Territory.","L’ENCYCLOPEDIE MONDIALE DES  OISEAUX - Dr  Christopher M. Perrins -  BORDAS -  ISBN: 2040185607

Charadriiformes Order – Chionidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Black-faced Sheathbill is the second member of the family Chionidae. It is  found in the sub Antarctic islands, living among penguins and giant petrels. It  is a terrestrial scavenger, often seen close to petrels around carcasses or  still living injured animals.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  38-41 cm
    Wingspan:  74-79 cm
    Weight:  450-760 g
The  adult has white plumage overall. It develops blunt, black carpal spurs, used  during aggressive encounters. 
    The  bill, bill sheath and facial pattern are black. The eyes are dark brown,  surrounded by pink eyering. Legs and feet vary according to the subspecies,  ranging from pink to dark purplish.
    Both  sexes are similar, with male slightly larger than female. 
    The  juvenile has smaller bill sheath and eyering. The immature has darker legs and  feet.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    There  are four subspecies forming two groups: the eastern group (Kerguelen and Heard)  and the western group (Prince Edward, Marion and Crozet Is). 
C.m. minor (here described) occurs on Kerguelen Is.
C.m. nasicornis is found on Heard and Mac Donald Is. This one  is very similar to nominate. It has shorter culmen, but larger bill sheath and  tarsus. 
    Both races  are larger and heavier than the following western subspecies. 
C.m. marionensis occurs on Marion and Prince Edward Is. 
C.m. crozettensis is found on Crozet I. 
    Both are  slightly smaller than eastern races, with smaller bill sheath and more  prominent, larger caruncles.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season is linked with that of penguins and other colonial seabirds. 
    The nest  is usually hidden within crevice, in small cave or petrel burrow, or behind  overhanging rock. This is a cup placed on top of untidy smelly pile of tussock  grass, moss, algae, feathers and old bones and debris. The nest is protected  from skuas and bad weather, and penguin’s  colonies may also provide more protection against predators.",,"The  Black-faced Sheathbill’s population is suspected to be declining due to  predation by invasive species (feral cats). The population size is estimated to  8,700/13,000 mature individuals. 
    But in  spite of some declines, the species is not currently threatened.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

Charadriiformes Order –  Charadriidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The Pacific Golden Plover was  formerly regarded as the same species that the American Golden Plover until 1993. But these species have different  habits and do not interbreed in W Alaska where the two forms overlap. They do  not winter together. The American Golden Plover migrates to S America while the Pacific Golden Plover flies from  Alaska to Pacific islands and to Australia.  
    The species is not globally  threatened and is now protected, but despite good numbers, the population is  decreasing. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 23-26 cm
    Wingspan: 60-72 cm
    Weight: 100-228 g
The Pacific Golden Plover adult in  breeding plumage has crown, nape, back, upperwing and uppertail densely  spangled with gold, black and white. 
    On the underparts, the black  extends from face and throat down to belly and flanks. The black parts are  bordered with white, and there is a black speckling along the white borders by  underparts and undertail. 
    While the breeding plumage is  developing, the bird shows gradual variations of both colour and marking,  making them difficult to identify. During the moult, the black breast becomes  yellowish-buff with dark speckling, but these parts darken to black as the  breeding plumage is in progress.","The Pacific Golden Plover breeds in  NC and NE Russia, from Yamal Peninsula E along coast, including Wrangel Island,  to Chukotskiy Peninsula, and S across Koryakskiy highlands to N Kamchatka. It  also breeds in W Alaska. 
    It winters from E Africa through S  Asia and Indonesia to Oceania, Australia and New Zealand. Small numbers are  regularly reported in S California.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The Pacific Golden Plover breeds  during the boreal summer. The egg-laying takes place between mid-May and July,  depending on the range. They usually return to the same nest-site year after  year. 
    The nest is probably built by the  male on the ground. It is a shallow depression lined with leaves, grass, moss  and lichens. It is placed on hummock with lichen or moss.",,"The Pacific Golden Plover is now  protected, but it was formerly hunted during the migration in Hawaii. 
    The global population is estimated  to number 190,000/250,000 individuals (2006). This population is suspected to  be decreasing, but currently, the Pacific Golden Plover is evaluated as Least  Concern.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The Double-banded  Plover is endemic to New Zealand where it is abundant and widespread on  seashores, in estuaries and riverbeds. It is known as Banded Dotterel in New  Zealand and the Maori’s name is Tutuwhatu. 
    The population  is currently declining, due to introduced mammalian predators which take both  eggs and chicks in the nest on the ground. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: 
Biometrics:
    Length:  18-21 cm
    Wingspan:  37-42 cm
    Weight:  47-76 g – Race exilis: 78-89 g 
The adult  in breeding plumage has rich grey-brown upperparts but the rump has white sides  and the outer rectrices are whitish. The flight feathers are blackish.   
    The underparts  are white, but we can see a broad chestnut breast band and a narrower black  neck band. 
On the  grey-brown head, there is a narrow, black, frontal bar above the white  forehead. Chin, throat and lower cheeks are white. 
    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are pale grey-green to  yellowish-green.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The Double-banded  Plover has two subspecies, here described and displayed.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The Double-banded  Plover arrives on the breeding grounds in July, and the laying occurs between  August and early November in lowlands, and mainly in October at higher  elevation. 
    The pairs  nest usually solitary, but in good and suitable habitat, there is sometimes  high concentration of birds. 
    The nest  is a shallow depression made in gravel, sand or soil. The scrape is often lined  with small stones or shells, and fragments of foliage or other vegetation  available in the surroundings.",,"The Double-banded  Plover’s population is estimated at about 50,000 birds and is declining due to  introduced mammalian predators. 
    There  are currently about 730 individuals of race exilis in Auckland Islands.

    The nest of the Pheasant-tailed Jacana is built on  floating vegetation. It is made with stems and pieces of aquatic plants. The  nest is built first by the male, and some substantial nests can be destroyed in  rising water, and the eggs are laid on floating leaf. For this reason, the male  often moves the clutch to another drier location. The male grips the eggs  between the throat and the breast and walks backwards on the floating  vegetation.","The Pheasant-tailed Jacana feeds mainly on insects  from the water surface, and invertebrates picked from roots and leaves of  aquatic vegetation. It grasps the roots with the bill and picks snails,  crustaceans and other invertebrates from them. It also picks preys from the  underside of the leaves of water-lilies. 
    It also takes small amounts of vegetation such as  seeds and ovules of lotus and water-lilies.","The Pheasant-tailed Jacana is threatened by the  drainage of wetlands for agriculture expansion, and human disturbances in  shallow water causing loss of nests and eggs. 
    The species is not globally threatened at this moment,  but some local declines are observed, especially throughout E China.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Volume 3 by Josep   del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN :   8487334202

    The Black-tailed Godwit has three  subspecies.
L.l.  islandica breeds in Iceland, Faeroes, Shetland and Lofoten Islands.  It winters in Ireland, Britain, W France, Spain and Portugal.   
    This race is smaller than nominate  with shorter bill (74-100 mm). The wings are longer and the plumage is darker.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:    
    The laying takes place between  April and mid-June. The Black-tailed Godwit nests on the ground among the short  vegetation, usually in wet grasslands near freshwater marshes. 
    The female lays 3-5 olive-green  eggs with brown markings. Both adults share the incubation during 22-24 days. At  hatching, the chicks have pale pinkish-cinnamon down with dark bands and  mottling on back. Both parents tend them. The young fledge about 28-34 days  after hatching. 
    The Black-tailed Godwit produces a  single brood per season, but a replacement clutch is laid is the first is lost.",,"The Black-tailed Godwit is  threatened by habitat loss due to changes in the habitat with drainage of wet  areas for agriculture, disturbance, pollution, hunting, grazing and trampling  of nests by cattle, reduction of prey abundance following changes in  agriculture, habitat fragmentation and climate change.  
    The population is estimated to number  140,000/270,000 pairs. This population is suspected to be declining, but there  is some degree of uncertainty about the sub-populations.

Charadriiformes Order – Scolopacidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Terek  Sandpiper is the only member of the genus Xenus. Short-legs and long, upcurved  bill make this bird very distinctive. Its foraging behaviour is more active  than the other Scolopacidae, as it  is frequently seen running about with the prey, in order to wash it before to  swallow it. 
    This species  is threatened by degradation and loss of the habitat, human pressure and  pollution, but the population is currently stable. 
    The first  individual was found in the Terek River on the NE edge of the Caucasus, giving  the bird its English name.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  22-25 cm
    Wingspan:  57-59 cm
    Weight:  50-126 g
The adult  in breeding plumage has grey-brown upperparts with narrow black streaks on  feathers, more conspicuous on scapulars where they form long, blackish lines. Rump,  uppertail-coverts and tail are usually paler grey than rest of upperparts. We can  see whitish tips to feathers in fresh plumage.
    On the  upperwing, the coverts vary from grey-brown to blackish-brown, with broadly  tipped white secondaries, forming a conspicuous trailing edge. 
The underparts  are white with grey wash on the breast, slightly darker and streaked with brown  on the sides, almost forming breast patches. The underwing is white with dark centres  to lesser coverts. 
On the  head, the lores are dark, and we can see a narrow dark line behind the eye. 
    The long-upcurved  bill is blackish with dull orange area at base. The eyes are dark brown,  surrounded by white eyering. Legs and partially webbed feet are bright orange  to greenish-yellow. 
    The bill  may vary in size and curving among individuals, but the females have slightly  larger bill than males.","The Terek  Sandpiper breeds from S Finland, NW Russia and Ukraine E through Siberia to Anadyr  land. It breeds in boreal taiga area and extends N into subarctic tundra and S  to steppe fringes. 
    Its wintering  areas include SW, S and E Africa through Middle East, S Asia and Indonesia to  Australia.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season takes place between May and July. 
    The Terek  Sandpiper nests on the ground in open in low vegetation and close to the water.  The eggs are laid in a scrape with a lining made with grass and debris.",,"The Terek  Sandpiper is affected by increasing pollution, degradation of the habitat due  to declining river flows, and human disturbances. However, the global  population appears stable and is estimated at 160,000/1,200,000 individuals. But  some population trends are still unknown. 
    But currently,  the Terek Sandpiper is evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The Common  Sandpiper is known for its bobbing walk, its flickering flight and the distinctive  white “peak” in front of the wing. 
    This Old  World wader frequents a variety of wetland habitats, both inland and coastal,  although it usually avoids open tidal mudflats. 
    The Common  Sandpiper is migratory and moves S overland on broad front, crossing deserts  and mountains, usually at night. This bird is a small, solitary wader, but  large flocks gather at nightime roosts, sometimes on moored boats.

INTRODUCTION:
    The Wood  Sandpiper is one of the strongest migrant species within the genus Tringa. It is  typically found on inland waters such as freshwater marshes, ricefields,  flooded grasslands, but it usually avoids estuaries’ flats and coasts. 
    This species  breeds in subarctic wetlands and winters in Africa, S Asia (India) and  Australia. 
    It is the  smallest wader of this genus. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  19-23 cm
    Wingspan:  34-37 cm
    Weight:  34-98 g
The Wood  Sandpiper adult in breeding plumage has blackish-brown upperparts, strongly  barred and spotted pale grey-brown and white. Rump and uppertail-coverts are  white. Rectrices are pale brown and narrowly barred white. 
    On the  underparts, chin and throat are white. Breast and neck are streaked and spotted  dark brown, fading into the whitish rest of underparts. The upper flank is  strongly barred brown. The underwing is white, slightly barred greyish-brown.","The Wood  Sandpiper breeds in N and C Europe through Siberia to Anadyr land, Kamchatka  and Commander Islands, and NE China. It is occasionally seen in Aleutian  Islands in spring. 
    It winters  in tropical and subtropical Africa, and across S and SE Asia to S China,  Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia. Some occasional individuals  have been recorded as far north as Britain.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The Wood  Sandpiper breeds in spring with the laying between May and mid-July. Is nests  solitary with about 1-10 pairs/km². However, in forested tundra, groups of 50  birds/km² are fairly common.
    The nest  is a shallow scrape among dense ground cover, lined with moss, leaves and other  plant material. It nests often in trees too, and uses nests abandoned by other  bird species.",,"The Wood  Sandpiper has very wide range where it is sometimes threatened by exploitation,  drainage and destruction of wetlands for forestry and agriculture, especially  in Finland. Climatic changes may affect this species too, and declines are reported  in S Sweden, Germany and Poland.
    The global  population was estimated to number 3,100,000/3,600,000 individuals in 2006, and  this population is suspected to be stable. 
    The Wood  Sandpiper is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

This species remains close to  moist areas until late summer. 
    It is mainly coastal outside the breeding season.  During migrations, it can be seen inland where it frequents the short-grass  salt-marshes. But it favours the stony shores, rocks, breakwaters, sandy  beaches with seaweed, sheltered inlets, estuaries, exposed reefs, mudflats and  lake shores.","Closely associated to the water, the Ruddy Turnstone  is very active, searching for food on rocks, in algae, on beaches. Very  conspicuous in flight, this bulky shorebird occurs in the coasts of the whole  world according to the seasons.","The Ruddy Turnstone breeds in the northern coasts of  Eurasia and North America, and winters along the southern coasts of all the  continents. 
    Highly migratory with high fidelity to wintering  areas, they migrate in flocks of 10’s birds.",,"The laying occurs from mid-May to early July, and  mainly mid-June in Canada. 
    The Ruddy Turnstone is monogamous and usually nests  solitary or in very loose colonies with about 3-8 pairs / km2. 
    The nest is on the ground, and often concealed in or  under vegetation, but sometimes in open areas. It is a shallow depression lined  with varied plant items found in the habitat. The nest is in dry, open tundra,  both in flat areas and slopes, but always near water such as ponds, lakes and  streams.","The Ruddy Turnstone’s name suggests that this bird  forages by turning over stones, but also seaweeds, leaves, shells and varied  objects, in order to find invertebrates. Then, it pecks or pursues them. It  occasionally may swim if necessary.","The Ruddy Turnstone is relatively common in its range,  and even extending the wintering areas in Europe. 
    Populations are globally stable and not threatened at  this moment.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Volume 3 by Josep   del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN :   8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The White-rumped Sandpiper is a  long-distance migratory species, travelling from Canada’s arctic islands to the  southern tip of South America, and even farther to islands lying near the  Antarctic Peninsula. This migration is performed in stages of up to 4000  kilometres that can last up to 60 hours.
    It nests on the arctic tundra,  usually near the coast. On migration and during winter, it frequents a variety  of both inland and coastal wetland habitats. It usually occurs in large flocks  on the wintering grounds. 
    The White-rumped Sandpiper is  threatened by degradation and habitat loss, and the population is suspected to  be decreasing. But currently, the species is not globally threatened.   
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length: 15-18 cm
    Wingspan: 36-38 cm
    Weight: 28-66 g
The White-rumped Sandpiper in  breeding plumage has pale chestnut-buff tinge on crown, ear-coverts and scapular  fringes. Shoulder and back feathers are mixed brown and grey. It has white  uppertail-coverts (not rump as mentioned in the name of the bird) contrasting  with the dark rump and tail. 
    On the white underparts, neck  sides, breast and flanks are pale with brown streaking and spotting. 
    The standing bird at rest shows  long primary tip projection beyond the tip of the tail. In flight, we can see a  white band on the uppertail. The male has inflatable throat used during the  displays.","The White-rumped Sandpiper breeds  in N Alaska and N Canada, E to S Baffin Island. It winters in SE South America,  from CE Brazil to Tierra del Fuego and Falkland Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:   
    The breeding season takes place  between June and August. The White-rumped Sandpiper nests solitary, and the  male defends strongly the territory during the egg-laying. The nests can be  placed from 12 to 475 metres apart (rarely 12 metres). 
    The nest is on the ground in the  wet tundra with grass and dwarf willows. It is well-hidden in a clump of grass  or moss. The female builds a cup-shaped depression lined with moss, lichen and  leaves, but this material is sometimes naturally present on the ground.",,"The White-rumped Sandpiper suffers  nest predation by skuas, arctic  foxes, Peregrine Falcon, Glaucous Gull, Common Raven and Sandhill Crane on the breeding grounds. 
    The species is threatened by  degradation and habitat loss. The population is suspected to be decreasing. But  currently, the White-rumped Sandpiper is evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  Volume 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334202

    The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet  are tinged greenish, yellowish or brownish.  
    Male and female have similar  plumage, but the female is slightly larger than male.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The Broad-billed Sandpiper has two  subspecies. 
L.f.  falcinellus breeds in Scandinavia and NW  Russia. It winters from E Africa, through S Red Sea and Arabia to W and S India  and Sri Lanka.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:    
    The breeding season takes place in  spring, with the egg-laying in June in Fennoscandia, and in June/July in  Russia. This species produces a single brood per season. 
    The Broad-billed Sandpiper nests in  loose colonies of about ten pairs. The male is strongly territorial and defends  the territory by aerial displays. It is aggressive towards other displaying  males until the end of the incubation. 
    The nest is often built on top of tussock,  wet sedges or moss cushion. It is a cup-shaped structure made with grass and  lined with leaves. It is usually well-raised above the water level.",,"The Broad-billed Sandpiper is threatened  by habitat loss in China and S Korea. Both locations are important stopovers  during the migration. It suffers the increase of environmental pollution and  heavy harvesting of benthic fauna. 
    The global population was estimated  at 71,000/160,000 individuals in 2006. The nominate race is estimated at  13,000/22,000 pairs and the race “sibirica”  at 16,000/18,000 individuals. The overall trend is decreasing. 
    But currently, the Broad-billed  Sandpiper is evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

    The wet  areas provide sources of food, mounds and slopes are used for displaying on  leks, and the nesting sites are mostly in dry areas with sedges and low scrubs. 
    Outside the  breeding season, the Ruff frequents a variety of shallow wetlands including the  muddy margins of freshwater or brackish lakes and pools. It also occurs in  ricefields, flooded grasslands and less frequently tidal mudflats.","Biometrics:
Male:  
    Length:  26-32 cm – Wingspan: 54-58 cm – Weight: 130-254 g
Female:  
    Length:  20-25 cm – Wingspan: 48-52 cm – Weight: 70-170 g
The Ruff  shows an extreme sexual dimorphism, and the male’s ornaments differ  individually in pattern and coloration. 
    The male  in breeding plumage has black barred lower back and tail. Mantle and scapulars  vary from black to brown, chestnut, ochre and white. 
    The  underparts are mostly dark, except the white lower belly, underwing and  undertail.  
Head-tufts  and ruff are highly variable in colour, including buff, chestnut, black-purple,  black or white plumage, often with barred or flecked pattern. 
    The bill  is brown or dull orange. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are  greenish-yellow to bright orange. The facial warts vary from greyish to  yellowish, orange or reddish to brown. 
Males  have a hierarchy based on plumage  colour while displaying.  The males “resident” or “independent males” have darker plumage, especially  head-tufts and ruff, whereas “satellite males” are slightly smaller and usually  have white or very pale ruff and tufts. 
    These  ornamental feathers are visible for relatively short time, usually April to  June. Outside this period, the male resembles female or Reeve in shape and  plumage, but it is significantly larger.","The Ruff  breeds in NW and N Europe, E through Siberia to Chukotskiy Peninsula and Sea of  Okhotsk. It winters from the coasts of W Europe and Mediterranean to  sub-Saharan Africa, through Middle-East to Indian Subcontinent and SE Asia. It also  occurs in Greater Sunda Islands and Philippines.
    It frequents  cool temperate areas in Europe, but it is an Arctic species over the Russian  range.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The Ruff  breeds in spring, with the laying in early May in NW Europe, mid-May in Sweden  and early June in Finnmark. 
    These birds  are polygynous with no true pair-bond. They nest solitary or can be loosely  colonial with widely spaced nests. 
    The nest  is on the ground, a shallow scrape lined with grasses and leaves, well-hidden among  the marshy vegetation. It is built by the female alone.",,"The Ruff  is threatened by habitat loss through drainage of wetlands and flood-plains for  irrigation and water management. Pollution and changing land management involve  scrubs and reed invasive overgrowth.
    The global  population is estimated to number 2,000,000/2,600,000 individuals (2006). The population  trend is decreasing but some populations appear to be stable and even  increasing in E Russia, whereas in Norway and Finland, the range has expanded S  since 1940s.

    Length: 18-19 cm
    Wingspan: 32-40 cm
    Weight: 36 g (28-40)  
The  Red-necked Phalarope adult female in breeding plumage has dark grey-brown upperparts with golden-buff lines bordering mantle  and scapulars. The larger scapulars, coverts and tertials have rufous-buff edges.  On the upperwing, we can see a narrow, white wingbar. Rump and tail are dark  grey, with whitish sides to the rump. 
    On the underparts, breast band and  flanks are grey. The rear flanks are white with dark grey spots. Belly and  undertail are white. On the white underwing, there is a dark bar across the median  underwing-coverts. 
Head and neck are dark grey to blackish.  The white chin and throat are usually outlined with grey. A chestnut-red band  extends from behind each eye down sides of neck to join across the foreneck  base. This collar is bordered below by the dark grey breast band.  
    The bill is fine, needle-like, and  slightly downcurving towards the tip. The eyes are brown, with white crescent  above. Legs and feet are blue-grey to dark grey. The toes are distinctly lobed  to help the swimming bird. This peculiar morphological feature gives the bird  the name “lobatus”.","The Red-necked Phalarope has  circumpolar breeding range and breeds in coastal regions of Arctic Ocean in  North America and Eurasia, S to Aleutians and British Islands.  
    It is pelagic during winter and can  be seen off CW South America, in Arabian Sea, and from C Indonesia to W Melanesia.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:

    The Red-necked Phalarope nest  solitary, and sometimes in loose colonies of up to 50 pairs with nests about  2-3 metres apart in restricted habitat. 
    The nest is on the ground and often  near water in low vegetation. It is a shallow depression lined with leaves and  grass. Male and female make several scrapes and the female selects one, and then,  both adults build the nest.",,"The Red-necked Phalarope has decreasing  populations throughout the wide range, due to natural events such as El Niño  and climate change. 
    The global population was estimated  to number 3,600,000/4,500,000 individuals in 2006.

During winter, the species appears to be pelagic  and during the breeding season, it feeds mainly at sea. 
    It breeds  mainly on snow-free areas, sometimes close to penguin or petrel’s colonies. The  nesting sites are mainly in coastal areas, but it also may form small inland  colonies in snow-free mountainous areas.","Similar to  bulky, broad-winged gull, the South Polar Skua has dark, pale and intermediate  morphs. This species differs slightly from other skuas in general body shape  with slighter body, thinner bill, smaller head and narrower wings.","The  South Polar Skua breeds on Antarctic Continent and Peninsula, and especially in  Ross Sea area where the pale morph birds predominate. The dark morph birds are  more numerous on Antarctic Peninsula. 
    This species  winters far north to Alaska and Greenland.",,"The breeding  season starts in November until February. 
    The  South Polar Skua forms loose colonies on bare, open grounds along the coasts. The  ground is often covered with lichens and mosses, in sheltered depressions free  of ice or snow. There are several prominent rocky outcrops giving a good view  over the territory. 
    The nest  is an unlined scrape on the ground.","The  South Polar Skua feeds at sea on fish and krill which are its main food. It may  take eggs and chicks of penguins if the Brown  Skua is away from the area, but it usually feeds mainly on fish. During winter,  the fish is probably complemented by scavenging.","The  South Polar Skua has large range, and in spite of low breeding success and  harsh weather conditions affecting chicks and adults, the populations do not  appear endangered, and the species is evaluated as Least Concern by BirdLife International.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

INTRODUCTION: 
    The Little  Tern is the smallest European tern. This species is migratory and winters  southwards. It is mainly found in coastal areas and feeds by hovering before  diving, sometimes in small, synchronized groups. They feed usually about 3-4  kilometres from their breeding colonies.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  22-28 cm
    Wingspan:  47-55 cm
    Weight:  47-63 g
The adult  has grey back and upperwing, and white rump, forked tail and underparts. The outermost  primaries are blackish. 
    On the  head, crown and lores are black, whereas the forehead is white.
    The long,  thin bill is bright yellow with reduced black tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs  and feet are yellow to orange-yellow. 
    Both sexes  are similar.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The Little  Tern has six subspecies which differ little.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season varies according to the range, but usually takes place when the food  resources are abundant. 
    The Little  Tern breeds in small to medium monospecific colonies, rarely more than 100  pairs with nest placed at least 2 metres apart. 
    The nest  is a scrape on the ground, on beaches of sand, pebbles, shell pieces, coral or  rock, usually placed above the high tide-line, a few metres away from water. However,  in marshy areas, the Little Tern may build a platform of vegetation or shells.",,"The Little  Tern is not currently threatened in spite of several local declines. This species  is vulnerable to human disturbances on beaches, and to predation by gulls and Corvids at colonies.  
    This species  has usually low breeding success rate due to loss of eggs and chicks by predation,  flooding of nest-site and bad weather involving nest failure.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal  - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

    During winter, this species lives mostly offshore, but  also on the seacoast, in estuaries and coastal lagoons. 
    During the migrations, it is often seen on coasts and  estuaries, but also at any wet area, ponds and even ditches.","The Black tern is a small dark tern, very graceful  when feeding at water surface.","The Black Tern subspecies “niger” occurs in  Europe and Western Asia, and winters on  African Atlantic coasts.
    The subspecies “surinamensis”  occurs in North America, and winters on the northern coasts of South America,  Pacific coasts of California and both Pacific  and Atlantic coasts of Central America. 
    They migrate in flocks and perform stopovers on lakes  and lagoons.",,"Breeding season occurs in May-June both in Europe and North America.
    The Black Tern favours marshes with floating  vegetation for nesting. This species nests in small colonies of usually about  20 pairs, rarely more than 100 pairs. It nests often over water of at least 50 cm depth, but also on  houses, in old nests of coots or grebes, boards…","The Black Tern feeds primarily on insects during the  breeding season (Coleopteran, Odonata and Ephemeridae). Outside the nesting  period, it feeds also on small fish and aquatic animals such as tadpoles, frogs  and snails. During the migration, they feed mainly on fish, but they also  consume insects and crustaceans.","The Black Tern’s populations are vulnerable or  declining locally, due to drainage of freshwater marshy habitat for  agriculture, and human disturbances. Predation at nest is common by muskrats  and also by pigs when water level is low. 
    Reduction of food availability due to eutrophication  of water, acidification of lakes, introduction of exotic fish species and  pollution by pesticides are some of the main threats.   
    However, the Black Tern is not threatened at this  moment.","HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Volume 3 by Josep   del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN :   8487334202

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Antarctic Tern ranges throughout the southern oceans and breeds on several  subantarctic islands. It is gregarious while breeding in loose colonies and  fishing in large flocks. The adults often co-operate to defend chicks and nests  against predators. 
    The  species is threatened by introduced mice, cats and rats to some islands, but  most of the breeding areas are now predator-free islands.
    Six  subspecies are currently recognized, but some of them are matter of some debate  and will become probably full species. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:  
Biometrics: 
    Length:  35-40 cm
    Wingspan:  75 cm 
    Weight:  150-180 g
The  adult has grey upperparts including the upperwing where the outer primaries  show variably grey to black outer webs. The rump and the deeply forked tail are  white. 
    The  underparts are greyish-white with white undertail-coverts. 
On the  head, forehead, crown and nape are black, contrasting with the white cheeks.  Chin and malar area are greyish-white like the underparts. 
    Bill,  legs and feet are red. The eyes are dark brown. 
    Both  adults are similar.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The  Antarctic Tern has six subspecies which differ in size and plumage tone. 
S.v. tristanensis is found on Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. 
S.v. georgiae is found in South Georgia, South Orkney  Islands, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island. 
S.v. gaini occurs in South Shetland Islands and Antarctic  Peninsula (S to Marguerite Bay). 
S.v. vittata is found on Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet,  Kerguelen, and Heard Islands in S Indian Ocean. 
S.v. sanctipauli occurs on Amsterdam and St Paul Islands in S  Indian Ocean. 
S.v. bethunei is found on Stewart Island, and Snares,  Auckland, Campbell, Macquarie, Bounty and Antipodes Islands.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season takes place mainly in November/December, with some variations according  to range, climate and food availability. The Antarctic Tern forms loose  colonies but also nests often solitary. 
    The nest  is a shallow depression on rock, cliff ledge, soil, sand or grassy ground. It  may contain some shells or pebbles, or flattened vegetation.",,"The Antarctic  Tern has wide range, but it is vulnerable to human disturbances and introduced  predators. 
    Total population  is unknown but must be about 50,000 pairs, with the main population of about 35,000  pairs on South Shetlands. 
    However,  the Antarctic Tern is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

Charadriiformes Order – Laridae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Kelp  Gull is present through much of the Southern Hemisphere. According to the  authors, 4 or 5 subspecies are recognized, but Kelp Gull’s taxonomy is still in  a state of uncertainty. As this species has extremely wide range, more  subspecies might be added in the future. However, you will find on this page numerous  pictures from several locations in the Southern Hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:  
    Length:  54-65 cm
    Wingspan:  128-143 cm
    Weight:  900-1300 g
The adult  is a typical gull with black upperparts and white tail. On the black upperwing,  the trailing edge is white and the  wing tip shows white patches. 
    Head,  neck, nape, tail and underparts are white.
  The bill  is yellow with red gonydal angle. The  eyes are yellow, surrounded by red or orange eyering. Legs and webbed feet are  greenish-yellow (mostly greyer in Africa).","CIES AND RANGE:  
    The Kelp  Gull can be considered a monotypic species, awaiting more information about the  subspecies. However, the 5 currently recognized races can be mentioned.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season varies, depending on the range, but usually occurs between September and  January. They breed in December in the Falklands and at any time on offshore  islands. 
    The Kelp  Gull breeds in colonies, from dozens (at range’s edges) to several hundreds of  pairs. The nest is built on rocks or sand, in well vegetated areas. It is often  placed under the protection of rock, bush or tree, or any vertical structure. This  is a bulky nest made with dried plants and seaweeds. It is lined with softer  vegetation.",,"The Kelp  Gull has large range and it is common and conspicuous in most part of its  distribution. The overall population is increasing with agriculture and fishery  expansion. 
    It is  often considered a pest in urban areas, and might have negative effect on the  coastal wildlife, through harassment and predation towards other bird species  and small animals. 
    The Falkland’s  population is about 30,000 breeding pairs. The global population is estimated to  number 3,300,000/4,300,000 individuals. 
    The Kelp  Gull is not currently threatened, and evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

    The Mew  Gull usually breeds in small colonies, but numerous pairs often nest solitary. The  laying occurs in May.
    The nest  site is placed on high ground near water, or at top of stump, on bare rock or  even in trees (mainly conifers), and on islands in marshes among the  vegetation. 
    The nest  is mainly built by the female, but the male remains in the surrounding and may  help sometimes. The nest is made with seaweeds, twigs, mosses, bark, grasses and  stems, forming a shallow cup of vegetation. In tree, the nest is mostly a  platform or a shallow cup of twigs and grasses.",,"The Mew  Gull is threatened on the breeding grounds by introduced ground predators such  as the American mink (Neovison vison) and by human disturbance. Habitat loss  through drainage, afforestation and various transformations is another threat  for this species.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 3 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal  - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334202

We see it in northern part in  summer, but it may be found in south and south-east regions all year round.",,"Laughing Gull reaches its  sexual maturity at two years. Breeding season starts in early April and may  last until July. 
    Laughing Gulls nest in  large colonies. The nest is usually in coastal areas, on the ground or among  grasses on the beach. It is rather large and made with grass and plant matter.
    Female lays 2 to 4 olive-brown  eggs, mottled black. Incubation lasts about 21 to 23 days, shared by both parents.  Young leave the nest a few days after hatching. Parents still raise them during  about 35 days.","Laughing Gull feeds on  aquatic invertebrates, shellfish, refuse, insects, earth worms and fish. It  sometimes steals other birds’ eggs and eats the nestlings.","Laughing Gull is threatened  by destruction of its coastal habitat, and repeated aggression by Herring Gulls  which steal its eggs and eat its chicks.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Volume 3 by Josep  del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal -  Lynx Edicions - ISBN : 8487334202

Urodynamis taitensis
Cuculiformes Order – Cuculidae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The  Long-tailed Cuckoo belongs to the subfamily Cuculinae which includes the Old World parasitic cuckoos. This  species lays the eggs in the nests of the Mohouidae,  and these tiny birds raise the young cuckoos.
    The  Long-tailed Cuckoo is a long-distance migrant. It breeds in New Zealand, but  after the breeding season, it performs a remarkable overwater migration to  winter in a vast arc of Pacific islands. It migrates at night while uttering  loud shrill notes, giving the bird the name of “screamer”.  
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  38-42 cm
    Weight:  120-125 g
The  adult male has rufous-barred brown upperparts, including the wings and the long  tail, as long as its body.
    The  underparts are white to rufous and streaked black from chin to vent. The  streaks are usually thick. 
The head  is blackish streaked rufous. There is a conspicuous white supercilium, and we  can see a dark moustachial stripe contrasting with the white lower cheek. 
    The bill  is yellow to horn-coloured. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are greyish. 
Both  sexes are similar, but some birds can be more rufous and are often females. 
    The  juvenile has dark brown, heavily spotted creamy-white upperparts. The  underparts are more or less tinged pale brownish, with thinner streaks than in  adults. The dark tail is barred whitish.","The  Long-tailed Cuckoo breeds in New Zealand where it is present all year round,  except during winter, as well for breeding, or on passage between breeding  locations. The breeding range includes New Zealand, Great and Little Barrier  Islands, Kapiti Island and Stewart Island.
    During  winter, it is found in an arc of Pacific islands extending over more than  10,000 kilometres, from Micronesia in the west, to Henderson Island in the  east.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The  laying occurs mostly in November and December. The eggs are laid in the nests  of the three Mohouidae, including  the Yellowhead, the Whitehead and the Brown Creeper or Pipipi. The adult cuckoo does not take part in  nesting duties.",,"The  Long-tailed Cuckoo has probably been affected by the decline of Yellowhead’s population. The clearance  of the subtropical rainforest in some parts of the wintering range could have  an impact on this species too. 
    The  numbers are unknown but in spite of probable decline, the Long-tailed Cuckoo  has large range and it is currently evaluated as Least Concern. In New Zealand,  it is listed as Nationally Uncommon.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD vol 4 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliott-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334229

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Buffy Fish-Owl feeds exclusively on fish and a variety of aquatic organisms. Some  morphological features are well-adapted to its feeding behaviour. This species  is rarely seen far from water, usually in forested areas and even close to  human habitations. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length:  40-48 cm
    Weight:  1030-2100 g
The  Buffy Fish-Owl is the smallest of the four fish-owls. 
    The adult  has buff upperparts with dark brown streaks and pale rufous edges to feathers. The  scapulars are paler, mostly whitish to pale buff. On the wings, the flight  feathers are barred buff and dark brown, with a few whitish bars. The rectrices  are dark brown with pale tips and a few buffish-white bars. 
The underparts  are warm buff with dark brown streaks, more conspicuous on neck and breast, and  thinner and sparser on belly and flanks. 
Head and  neck are similar to the upperparts, but the feathers lack the pale tips. Forehead  and eyebrows are white. The facial disk is pale buff. The floppy ear-tufts are  directed sideward, stilted at 45 degrees.
    The bill  is black. The eyes are yellow. The long, yellowish-grey tarsi are unfeathered  along with the toes. The soles of the feet are covered with spiny scales. The claws  are dark horn.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The  Buffy Fish-Owl has two subspecies:
K.k. ketupu (here described and displayed) occurs in SE  Asia, Malay Peninsula, Riau Archipelago, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo and  Bangka.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:
    The breeding  season varies according to the range. 
    The laying  occurs mainly between February and April, but in W Java, the eggs are led from  May to July, and in April and September to January in Malay Peninsula. 
    The  Buffy Fish-Owl nests in large hollow in tree, in tree-fork or among the Bird's  nest ferns (Asplenium nidus) between 3 and 18 metres above the ground. It may  use an abandoned raptor’s nest too, and uses occasionally a cave in rocky area.  They do not build their own nest.",,"The  Buffy Fish-Owl is sometimes affected by local persecution due to its fishing  behaviour in areas with fish ponds. This behaviour involves competition with  the local fishers. This species is scarce to fairly common throughout the range,  and the population appears currently stable.

Some local populations can be found on Melville Island, and in the Kimberley region, and  some islands off the coast.",,"Breeding season occurs from mid-October to  February-March, varying with rainy season. Nesting occurs during wet season. 
    Rainbow Pitta nests in trees, at about 20 metres above the  ground, but nest can be built in clumps of bamboo, thickets, on tree stumps or  logs among fallen debris, and even on the ground between tree roots.  
    Both adults build a bulky dome-shaped nest with simple  lateral entrance. Nest is made with small twigs and sticks, and other material  such as leaves, bark, ferns and parts of palm fronds can be added. But Rainbow  Pitta uses available materials and it is very adaptive. 
    Female lays 3 to 4 white or creamy-white eggs, with  dark marks. Incubation lasts about 14 to 15 days by both parents. Young fledge  about two weeks after hatching, and are fed by both adults. They remain in  their natal territory for 15 to 20 days before to disperse.","Rainbow Pitta has varied diet, feeding on earth worms  and other invertebrates. It also consumes caterpillars, ants, bugs, dipterans’  larvae, spiders, butterflies, beetle larvae, snails, small frogs and fruits.",Rainbow Pitta is locally common in suitable habitat.

Passeriformes Order – Rhipiduridae Family
INTRODUCTION:
    The New  Zealand Fantail was named « this fairy of the bush » by William  Herbert Guthrie-Smith, naturalist and birdwatcher born in 1862 in Scotland. 
    This pretty  bird is moving continuously and the long, flickering fanned tail is constantly  used in flight, during displays and while foraging and feeding. 
    It is  mainly a forest species, but it is well-adapted to human developments and has  become quite confiding. Its local Maori’s name is “Piwakawaka”. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  14-17 cm
    Weight:  6,5 - 9 g 
There  are two colour morphs. The pied morph (here displayed) is more common than the  black morph which is about 12/25% of South I population, and less than 1% of  North I birds.    
The  adult male of nominate race has olive-brown upperparts. The upperwing is dark  brown with double white wingbar formed by the whitish tips of greater and  median wing-coverts. The inner secondaries are edged whitish too. On the  uppertail, the central rectrices are brownish-black and show white shafts and  tips. The tail feathers 2-5 are white, with brownish-black edges to outer webs. The outer rectrices are  greyish-white.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    There  are three recognized subspecies. The fourth race “R.f. cervina” from Lord Howe Island is extinct since 1920s.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The  breeding season varies depending on the range, usually August/March in North I,  September/January in South I, and late October/late December in Chatham Islands. 
  This  species often produces 2-5 broods, according to the location. They are solitary  nesters.",,"The New  Zealand Fantail is usually common in forested areas in New Zealand and adjacent  islands. As they have adapted to human developments, the population is stable  or increasing, although there are some declines in highly urbanized areas, and  after prolonged periods of cold or hard weather conditions. 
    Predation  by introduced species including rats, cats, possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Common  Myna is an important threat for eggs, chicks and adults. 
    The Chatham population is abundant but with very  variable numbers and restricted range. The global population is not quantified,  but this species is common to locally abundant, and it is currently evaluated  as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 11 by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott and David  Christie - Lynx  Edicions - ISBN: 849655306X

INTRODUCTION:
    The  Brown Shrike is a small, migratory shrike, often seen perched in upright stance.  This is a very typical shrike that hunts from perches and impales prey on horny  branches.  
    This  species breeds in central and eastern Asia, and spends the winter in India, SE  Asia and Indonesia. It frequents open country with bushes and scattered trees. 
    The  Brown Shrike has four subspecies that differ in plumage pattern and coloration. 
    This  species is not globally threatened, although its population is declining. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics: 
    Length:  17-20 cm
    Weight:  M: 27-34 gr – F: 28-37 gr
The  Brown Shrike adult male of nominate race has rufous-brown crown and nape and  slightly duller upperparts, except the rump and the uppertail-coverts that are slightly  brighter. The upperwing is mostly dark brown with wing-coverts and inner  flight-feathers edged whitish. The tail is dull rufous, with paler edges and  tips on outer rectrices. 
The  underparts are whitish with pale rufous tinge, except on the white chin and  throat. The undertail-coverts are pale brownish-grey.
On the  head, crown and nape are rufous-brown. We can see a conspicuous black facial  mask extending from lores through the eye to rear ear-coverts. There is a broad  white supercilium. The lower forehead is creamy-white.
    The  hooked bill is black. The eyes are brown. Legs and feet are blackish.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The  Brown Shrike has four subspecies.
L.c. cristatus (described above) breeds in C and E Siberia, S  to N Mongolia, L. Baikal area, N Sakhalin and W Kamchatka. It winters in C and S  India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar coastal area and Malay Peninsula.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season varies according to the range, but it usually takes place in spring,  with the laying in May/June. They produce a single brood per season. However,  the female lays a replacement clutch if the first is lost before the chicks  hatch.",,"The  Brown Shrike is not globally threatened and there is little information on  population levels. No information on status of races cristatus and confusus. The  race superciliosus has declined drastically  in Japan. The status of the race lucionencis in Japan is uncertain.

Passeriformes Order – Cisticolidae Family
INTRODUCTION: 
    The Zitting  Cisticola is an Old World Warbler whose wide range includes variations of  populations with 18 recognized subspecies. It often occurs in grasslands and  near water where it spends most time foraging among the vegetation, searching  for insects and larvae. 
    The Zitting  Cisticola is known for its aerial displays accompanied by regular “dziip”  calls. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:
Biometrics:
    Length: 10  cm
    Weight:  M: 7-12 g – F: 5-8 g
The adult  has buffy or rufous-brown upperparts with dark streaks on crown, mantle, back  and uppertail-coverts, and almost plain rump. The upperparts become duller and  darker in worn plumage. 
    Flight feathers  and tail are dark brown. We can see buff margins on flight-feathers and  upperwing-coverts, whereas the tail is edged rufous-brown with blackish subterminal  band and white tips (in fresh plumage). 
    The underparts  are creamy-buff with paler throat and central belly. Flanks and vent are  cinnamon-buff.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The Zitting  Cisticola has 18 recognized subspecies which differ mainly in plumage tone with  paler or browner birds according to the range. 
    This species  breeds in southern Europe, Africa (except deserts and rainforest) and S Asia,  down to N Australia. The birds of the NE parts of the range are migratory and  winter in regions of C and S India.",,"OF THIS SPECIES:  
    The breeding  season occurs between March and September in Europe, but this period varies  depending on the range. The male attracts a female by flying in pendulum flight  over her, then, it leads her to the nest-site, and finally, it circles 1 metre  above her while giving soft calls. 
    The male  builds a vertical pear-shaped nest with an entrance at top. It uses live  vertical grass leaves held together with vegetal down and spider web. This  structure is placed between 10 and 50 centimetres in dense clump of grass. Once  the nest is selected by the female, she lines it with plant down, fine grass,  spider web and wool. 
    The male  starts to build a new nest as soon as the female uses the existing one, or if  this nest is not used after one week.",,"The Zitting  Cisticola is common throughout most parts of the wide range. The population is  increasing, following expansion of the range in recent years. 
    The global  population is unknown, but the European breeding population is estimated at  230,000/1,100,000 breeding pairs, equating to 690,000/3,300,000 individuals. 
    The Zitting  Cisticola is currently evaluated as Least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 11 by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott and David  Christie - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 849655306X

In other parts of the range, it is found in lowland forests at 150  to 200 metres,  and also between 800 and 1400   metres; 
    During migration and in winter, it is found in more  open woodlands, edges of cultivated areas with scattered trees, coastal wooded  areas (mangroves), parks and gardens.","Narcissus Flycatcher’s name comes from the yellow  colour of the Narcissus flower. 
    Adult male is brightly coloured. It has black and  orange or yellow plumage. 
    On the upperparts, mantle and upper back are black.  Upper wings are brownish-black with white patch on inner greater coverts.  Uppertail coverts and tail are black. The lower back and the rump are yellow. 
    On the underparts, chin, throat and breast are bright  orange-yellow. The rest of the underparts are whitish, with pale yellow flanks. 
    On the head, crown, nape, lores, cheeks and  ear-coverts are black. We can see a conspicuous yellow or orange-yellow  supercilium, from lores to ear-coverts. 
    The thin bill is dark grey-blue, sometimes with darker  upper mandible. Eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are bluish-grey.","Narcissus Flycatcher breeds in North-east China, Japan and Russia,  on Sakhalin Island. 
    It winters in South-east Asia, and cross the South Korea, in  order to reach its breeding areas.",,"Breeding season occurs from May to July.
    Narcissus Flycatcher often uses natural cavities such  as hollow in tree trunk, or bark crevice, but it may also nest among a mount of  cut or fallen branches.  The nest is  placed at about 1, 50 to 4, 50   metres above the ground.  
    Hole-nesting could be a defence against brood  parasitism by Cuculidae. 
    The nest is cup-shaped, and made with leaves and plant  fibres. It is lined with softer grass. 
    Female lays 3 to 5 white eggs with fine red markings.  Incubation lasts about two weeks, mainly by female, but both parents rear the  young and feed them.

They roost in trees, damaging them. Their droppings can  damage vehicles and other products with the uric acid they contain. 
    Large populations of starlings cause damages in crops  or stored grain, and on fruit crops, especially berries. 
    The most common problem associated with starling  nesting in buildings is vectors of reintroduction of fowl mites and other pests  invading buildings. They also transmit disease organisms to human and  livestock.
    Exclusion is always the best option to this nuisance,  closing large opening with varied solutions, avoiding bird’s nesting. 
    Traps, shots and poison are illegal, but sometimes  used. Sounds are tried to scare away birds, but they come back rapidly.","L’ENCYCLOPEDIE MONDIALE DES  OISEAUX - Dr  Christopher M. Perrins -  BORDAS -  ISBN: 2040185607

But farther south, it breeds in wooded slopes and swampy areas, and riverine  thickets with various tree species. 
    Outside  breeding season, it is found in a variety of scrubby wooded habitats,  especially with birches and alders by streams, and in brushy or weedy fields. 
    This species  can be seen from sea-level up to more than 1000 metres of elevation  (1100-1350m) and up to 1850-2100 metres in Altai where it breeds in alpine  meadows.","Biometrics:
    Length:  12,5-14 cm
    Wingspan:  21-23 cm
    Weight: 10-17  gr
The Common Redpoll adult male is a small grey to brownish-grey  finch, with conical bill and slightly forked tail. The upperparts show  extensive dark grey-brown streaking, with whitish fringes to mantle feathers  and scapulars. The greyish-white rump is tinged pink, the uppertail-coverts are  grey-brown with dark centres, and the tail is dark grey with narrow buffy-white  edges. The upperwing is dark brown and shows a double pale wingbar formed by  the white or whitish-buff tips of median and greater wing-coverts. The  flight-feathers show narrow pale edges. 
The  underparts are pale greyish-white, but throat and breast are tinged pink.  Flanks and sides of belly are streaked brownish. Belly and undertail-coverts  are whiter, with broad tapering dark shaft streaks, sometimes absent. 
On the  head, lower forehead and lores to chin are black, whereas upper forehead and  forecrown are deep red. Crown to nape are pale grey to greyish-buff with fine  dark streaks. We can see a narrow, pale supercilium extending to rear of  ear-coverts, and a thin, dark eye stripe. Cheeks and ear-coverts are pale  grey-brown with buffish or pinkish wash on lower parts. 
    The  short, conical bill is horn-coloured with dark tip, generally dull yellow or  pale horn with darker culmen and tip. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are  blackish.","CIES AND RANGE: 
    The  Common Redpoll has very complex taxonomy varying according to the authors. In  addition to the two usually recognized subspecies, the Lesser Redpoll (A.  cabaret) is also considered a subspecies on this page.",,"OF THIS SPECIES: 
    The breeding  season takes place from late April to August. The northernmost birds produce a  single brood, whereas elsewhere, two broods can be laid, according to food availability. 
    The nest  is usually placed up to 5 metres above the ground, in tree or shrub, often on  branch close to the trunk or in canopy. In Scandinavia and N Russia, it may  nest in vicinity of Fieldfares on  more exposed branches. In northern tundra, it often nests in low bush, hummock  or rocky ledge.
    The nest  is built by the female but the male sometimes collects material. The cup-shaped  structure is made with grass, fine twigs and moss, and the cup is lined with  feathers, plant down and animal hair. They may take material from an old nest,  but do not reuse it.",,"The Common  Redpoll has large range in which it is common to locally common. The global  breeding population is estimated by Partners in Flight at 160,000,000 (22% in  USA and 17% in Canada). Estimated European population, 1,200,000/2,400,000  pairs, and between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 pairs in Russia. 
    The race  “rostrata” has extended its range N  in Greenland in the 20th century. 
    The race  “cabaret” has also extended its  range to Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and S Sweden, Czech Republic and N and C  Germany. The populations are still increasing throughout the European range, but  the British Islands breeding population has declined since 1970s, due to  decrease of young coniferous woodlands availability. It has recently been moved  to the Red List of Species of Conservation Concern. The species is common in  New Zealand where it was introduced.  
    But currently,  the Common Redpoll is evaluated as least Concern.","HANDBOOK  OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD Vol 15 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-David Christie  - Lynx Edicions –  ISBN: 9788496553682

    On the  underparts, chin and throat are pale yellowish. Rest of underparts is yellowish  with dark streaks on breast and rear flanks. We can see an olive-rufous  breastband, with more rufous on breast sides and upper flanks. 
In worn  plumage (May/August), the head is more yellow with a dark pattern sometimes  restricted to narrow blackish streaks above the supercilium, but very faint  above the eye. There is a dark greenish eye stripe curving down the rear of  ear-coverts to lower rear corner of cheeks. The nape is yellow and  greenish-grey, and the upperparts are brighter than in autumn. Below, the  breast is mostly rufous.
