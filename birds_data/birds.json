    "Diet": "The Emu  is omnivorous, but it feeds regularly on highly nutritious food. It feeds on  seeds, fruits, flowers and tender roots. In summer, large quantities of insects  are eaten, especially caterpillars, grasshoppers and beetles.

    "Description": "Garrodia nereis\nProcellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family\nINTRODUCTION: \n    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is included in the subfamily Oceanitinae in the family  Hydrobatidae. It is the only member of the genus Garrodia. This species occurs  in Southern Ocean. It differs from other storm-petrels by the grey back and  inner part of the wing, and the pale grey rump instead of white. \n    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is vulnerable on land, and predation by the Brown Skua is a major threat at breeding colonies. It is mainly  solitary, although sometimes seen in small groups. They nest in loose colonies. \n    The Grey-backed  Storm-Petrel is the smallest storm-petrel in the New Zealand region, but this  sparrow-sized bird has very powerful flight in full force gales in New Zealand subantarctic  waters.   \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length:  16-19 cm\n    Wingspan:  39-40 cm\n    Weight:  35 g (21-44 g)\nThe adult  has blackish-grey head, throat, neck and upper breast, whereas mantle, back and  wings are dark grey. On the upperwing, two pale wingbars are formed by the pale  grey tips of both median and greater coverts. Rump and uppertail-coverts are  pale grey to silvery grey. The rectrices are darker grey at base, and mostly blackish-grey  at tip, forming a dark terminal band. \n    In fresh  plumage, the upperparts have scaly appearance due to the pale-tipped feathers. \n    The underparts  are white and contrast strongly with the dark hood. On the underwing, the  trailing edge is dark grey and the leading edge is dark and broader. The flanks  may sometimes show grey streaks while some grey bars are visible on the  undertail-coverts. \n    The bill  is black. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are grey-black. \n    Male and  female have similar appearance, although female is usually larger overall. \n    The juvenile  is similar to adults.",

    "Description": "el \nFregetta tropica\nProcellariiformes Order – Hydrobatidae Family\nINTRODUCTION:\n    The  Black-bellied Storm-Petrel occurs throughout the Southern Ocean and breeds on  several subantarctic islands. As it prefers cold waters, it is a true  subantarctic breeder.\n    The genus  Fregetta includes two main species, but actually, there are six distinct forms.  They belong to the Southern Subfamily Oceanitinae that shows great taxonomy diversity. \n    This species  is threatened by invasive and introduced predators to their breeding islands.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length:  20 cm\n    Wingspan:  43-46 cm\n    Weight:  43-63 g\nThe adult  has rather compact body with rounded wings and short, square-tipped tail.\n    Head,  neck, breast and upperparts including wings and tail, are blackish-brown, whereas  rump and belly are white. Black vent and central belly stripe are variable. This  stripe connects the blackish throat and breast to vent and undertail-coverts. On  the underwing, flight feathers and leading edge are blackish, whereas the  underwing-coverts are white in the centre of the wing. On the upperwing, the  coverts are browner than the blackish flight feathers. We can see some pale  fringes to scapulars and tips of greater coverts, forming an indistinct panel  even in fresh plumage. The undertail is blackish. \nThe bill  is black and hooked at tip. The long, tubular, external nostrils might allow  the bird to detect food by smell. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet  are black. \nBoth adults  are similar although the female has slightly larger wings, tail and tarsus. \n    The juvenile  resembles adult.",

Both differ from genus Diomedea in  having more pointed and narrower wings, longer wedge-shaped tail and peculiar  head pattern. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length:  84-89 cm\n    Wingspan:  200-203 cm\n    Weight:  M: 2200-3250 g – F: 2100-2800 g\nThe adult  has entirely sooty-brown plumage with browner head and neck and very dark face.  Belly, wings and tail are variably darker whereas neck and body are slightly paler. \n    In worn  plumage, hindneck to mantle can be much paler and contrast with the head. On the  wings, the white shafts of the outer primaries are conspicuous, and can be seen  even at distance. \nThe bill  is black and shows yellowish-pink stripe on the sides of the lower mandible,  but this stripe does not reach the bill tip. The eyes are dark grey to dark  brown, surrounded by broad, white eyering, becoming narrower and broken on  lores. Legs and webbed feet are pale pinkish to bluish-grey. \n    Both adults  are similar, but the female is smaller than male.",

This species was first seen off the  New Zealand coasts. French, English and scientific names pay tribute to this  artist. \n    This petrel  is the smallest species of genus Procellaria. Often solitary at sea, it may  feed in small groups associated with marine mammals.  \n    The small  population appears currently stable, but the species has restricted breeding  range and is threatened by the usual introduced predators. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length:  46 cm\n    Wingspan:  112-123 cm\n    Weight:  700 g\nThe adult  has sooty-black plumage with slightly darker head and neck. \n    On the  underwing, coverts and bases of primary flight feathers are paler and greyer. \n    The bill  is pale yellowish with greyer culmen and tip.

Like other petrels, it breeds in colonies and nests  in burrows. It is marine and pelagic, and returns to islands only for breeding. \n    It forages  in the open sea by diving, and can reach depths of 10 metres. It uses its wings  for swimming underwater. It is attracted by fishing boats where it is  threatened by baited fish hooks. \n    Mammal predators  on breeding islands are responsible for declines, and this species is currently  listed as Near Threatened.  \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: \nBiometrics:\n    Length:  48-50 cm\n    Wingspan:  115-130 cm\n    Weight:  760-1520 g\nThe adult  is a heavy-bodied seabird with narrow, long wings and ashy-grey plumage above  and white below. \n    The head  is dark grey to brownish-grey, but nape and upperparts are paler, slightly  darker on the upperwing, and even more on the tail. The upperparts show  slightly scaled pattern at close range.\n    On the  underparts, the underwing is dark grey to brownish-grey, including the  axillaries. The wedge-shaped tail is grey. Rest of underparts is whitish, but  thighs and undertail-coverts may show some brownish-grey tinge. \nThe head  may appear hooded sometimes, according to the distance and the light. \n    The stout  bill varies from greenish to yellowish or grey, but it is mostly ivory with blackish  culmen.

    "Description": "Petrel is highly pelagic and occurs in Southern Ocean. It breeds on several  subantarctic islands including Gough, Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet and  Kerguelen Islands, and probably Tristan da Cunha. \nHABITAT: \n    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds in colonies established near the sea on flat or gently sloped  tundra, or on slopes covered with tussock grass. It nests in self-excavated  burrow. \n    Outside the  breeding season, it is marine and pelagic, and occurs mainly in cold waters. \nCALLS AND SONGS: \n    The Kerguelen  Petrel is usually silent at sea where it is often solitary. At colonies, this  species is relatively quiet, only giving wheezy “chee-chee-chay” while flying  over the burrows. Some higher-pitched, more drawn-our sounds can be heard too.\nBEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: \n    The Kerguelen  Petrel feeds mainly on squid (Gonatus antarcticus), some fish and crustaceans,  especially krill of genus Euphausia, and cephalopods. \n    Squid is  caught at night by surface-seizing, but it also performs dipping and surface-plunging.  It may associate with cetaceans that lead the preys close to the surface.\nIt is  usually solitary at sea, but it may take part to exuberant chases if numerous seabirds  are present. However, small groups of 4-5 birds congregate at food sources. It shows  little interest in ships. \n    When feeding  in open waters around Antarctica, it can be seen with Cape Petrel, Blue Petrel and Antarctic Prion.   \nThe Kerguelen  Petrel is nocturnal at colonies, although it may sometimes visit them by day. They  are monogamous. They breed in colonies and only defend the burrow. The laying occurs  in October, after a pre-laying exodus of four weeks in September. \nThe Kerguelen  Petrel adults may visit the colonies all year round. They frequent subantarctic  and Antarctic waters S to pack ice throughout the year. \n    It disperses  widely S through Southern Ocean N to 40°S, sometimes to South Africa, Australia  and New Zealand. It may occasionally disperse as far as the Falklands and South  Georgia. \nThe Kerguelen  Petrel performs a spectacular fast flight in strong winds, often in high  sweeping arcs and long glides. It may hover in Falco-like fashion at 20-30  metres above the water. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: \n    The breeding  season takes place between August and January/February, with the egg-laying in  October.   \n    The Kerguelen  Petrel breeds colonially on tussock-covered slopes with soft, wet soil in which  it digs the long burrow (0,80-2,80 metres) lined with vegetation. The entrance is  sheltered by tussock grass from strong winds. \nThe female  lays a single white egg. The incubation lasts 46-51 days, shared by both adults  in long stints of 10-15 days. \n    At hatching,  the chick is covered with sooty-brown down. It is brooded for the first two  days. Both parents feed it and it fledges about 59-62 days after hatching. \n    This species  produces a single brood per season.\nPROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS: \n    The Kerguelen  Petrel has wide range in which it is abundant. There is extensive predation by  rats and cats in Crozet Islands, whereas skuas and dogs take some birds at Gough and Tristan da Cunha.\n    The global  population was estimated at about 1,000,000 individuals in 2004, and appears to  be stable.\n    The Kerguelen  Petrel is currently evaluated as Least Concern.",

    "Description": "lecanoides urinatrix\nProcellariiformes Order – Pelecanoididae Family\nINTRODUCTION:\n    The diving-petrel’s  taxonomy is still a matter of some debate, and depending on the authors, these  birds can be placed in the family Procellariidae or in the family Pelecanoididae  (like on this page). There are four species of small, stocky seabirds highly  adapted to the aquatic life. \n    The Common  Diving-Petrel has the widest range, but it is threatened by introduced and  invasive species on the breeding islands where it nests in burrows.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: \nBiometrics: \n    Length:  20-25 cm\n    Wingspan:  33-38 cm\n    Weight:  86-185 g\nThe adult  is very similar to the Little Auk or  Dovekie (Alle alle) of the Northern Hemisphere. But there is any relation  between the two families. \n    The upperparts,  including upperwing and uppertail, are grey-black. The short, rounded wings are  browner, especially on primaries. In fresh plumage, the rectrices have whitish  tips. \n  The underparts  are dusky white with grey underwing, mostly dark grey on axillaries and  marginal coverts. The undertail is grey. There are some grey spots on body  sides and rear flanks. \nOn the  head, we can see a blackish-grey mask through the eyes and on anterior  ear-coverts. Supercilium and neck-sides are dull white. There is a large grey  to dark grey patch on breast-sides, sometimes forming a complete collar.   \nThe short,  broad-based, hooked bill is blackish-grey, but the lower mandible has paler  base and pale horn spot at centre. It is formed by several horny plates. The two  external tubular nostrils are open upwards (forwards in other petrels) as an  adaptation for diving. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and webbed feet are pale  blue with blackish webs and soles.",

The skin is less dark  on chin and lores. \n    The  thick, long bill is bright yellow in males, with variable olive wash. It can be  sometimes light horn with grey tinge at base. The eyes are golden yellow to  amber. Legs and webbed feet are yellow-orange, sometimes olive.",

    "Description": "o verrucosus\nSuliformes Order – Phalacrocoracidae Family\nINTRODUCTION:\n    The Kerguelen Shag is often considered  a subspecies of the Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), but it differs by its small size and shorter bill, more  rounded wings, all black upperparts (with no white on wings or back), dull brownish  legs and feet and bluish-grey eyering. \n    It is endemic to Kerguelen Islands  in S Indian Ocean. It breeds in colonies along the coasts of some islands of  the archipelago, and forages in open inshore waters. \n    The Kerguelen Shag is not globally  threatened but it has fairly small breeding range.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length: 65 cm\n    Wingspan: 110 cm\n    Weight: 1700-2240 g\nThe Kerguelen Shag adult has black  head, hindneck, upperparts (including wings and tail) and outer part of the  thighs, with blue gloss becoming mostly bronzy green on scapulars and  upperwing. \n    The underparts are white, including  chin, throat, lower cheeks and neck sides. The underwing is blackish with brownish  wash. \n    On the head, we can see a long,  erectile black crest formed by several up curved feathers on crown. The head is  black from crown to malar area, with greenish-blue gloss. \nDuring the breeding season, there  are some white filoplumes above and behind the eye. The crest is usually lost  as the breeding season progresses, like the filoplumes. The plumage becomes  duller too. \n    We can see conspicuous warty yellow  caruncles on the sides of the forehead. Gape, base of mandibles and gular pouch  are dark brown, and the bare skin is densely covered with numerous tiny yellow tubercles. \n    The eyes are dark brown, surrounded  by broad, blue eyering. The bill is dark grey with brown tinge and paler at  tip. Legs and webbed feet are pink with dark areas on joints and webs.  \nOutside the breeding season, the caruncles  become smaller and dull orange-buff, and the eyering is duller. The facial skin  is paler and duller.    \n    Male and female are similar. The Kerguelen  Shag resembles other “blue-eyed” shags but it is smaller.  \nThe juvenile has dark brown  upperparts and a variable amount of dark brown on the underparts. The eyes are  brown. The caruncles are absent. The facial skin is dull and legs and feet are brownish. \n    The immature has more glossy  plumage and gradually acquires the white underparts. \nRANGE:  \n    The Kerguelen Shag is endemic to  the Kerguelen Islands in S Indian Ocean, one of the most remote areas on Earth.  It nests on the main island of the archipelago (Grande Terre), on some offshore  islands and on islands in the Golfe du Morbihan (Kerguelen), on the E coast of  Grande Terre. \nHABITAT: \n    The Kerguelen Shag nests on exposed  stretches along the coasts, but also in more sheltered areas. It forages at sea  throughout the islands of the archipelago, often in bays or inlets, usually  within six kilometres of the shore. During summer, if feeds among kelp. \nCALLS AND SOUNDS:\n    The Kerguelen Shag male is more  vocal than the female, and usually makes croaking, groaning and growling. The female  produces softer hissing sounds. \nBEHAVIOUR IN THE WILD: \n    The Kerguelen Shag feeds on fish  and aquatic invertebrates such as echinoderms, crustaceans and marine worms. Like  all Phalacrocoracidae, it feeds  mainly by pursuit-diving underwater. \n    During the breeding season, it  usually forages alone, but outside this period, they feed in large flocks,  forming linear flocks of several hundred individuals. \n    Some of them feed on introduced  brown trout (Salmo trutta) and brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis) in freshwater  lakes on Kerguelen.  \nThe Kerguelen Shag breeds in  colonies of 30 to 400 pairs, depending on the island. The male performs the  typical courtship displays such as “Gargling”. It throws its head back until the  nape touches the rump, while the bill is wide open. This display is accompanied  by calls. Both adults share the nesting duties. They are monogamous. \nThe Kerguelen Shag is sedentary and  only disperses throughout the islands of the archipelago after the breeding  season. Some immature birds are recorded up to 80 kilometres from the islands,  over the continental shelf. But most colonies are often occupied year-round.  \n    The Kerguelen Shag has powerful  flight with regular, continuous wingbeats, sometimes interspersed with glides. \nREPRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIES: \n    The egg laying period varies  depending on the colony. It usually occurs between September and January, with  peak in October/November. The colonies may include 30 to 400 pairs, and they  are sometimes established close to penguin colonies. \n    The nest is a truncated cone made  with grass and seaweeds, cemented together with mud and guano. It is generally  built on cliff ledge or in rock crevice. It can be reused in several following  years if not destroyed. \nThe female lays 2-4 eggs and both  adults share the incubation during about one month. At hatching, the chicks are  naked, but a dark brown down growths very soon.  \n    They are preyed upon by skuas, gulls and sheathbills,  in spite of heavy protection by their parents.  \nPROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS:    \n    The Kerguelen Shag is considered  fairly abundant throughout its restricted range. It is not globally threated  outside the natural predation. \n    The population is estimated at  12,000 pairs and appears to be stable. \n    The Kerguelen Shag is currently evaluated  as Least Concern. \nFr: Cormoran des Kerguelen\n    Ang: Kerguelen Shag\n    All: Kerguelenscharb\n    Esp: Cormorán de las Kerguelen\n    Ita: Cormorano delle Kerguelen\n    Nd: Kerguelenaalscholver\n    Sd: kerguelenskarv\nText  by Nicole Bouglouan\nSources: \nHANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD  vol 1 by Josep del Hoyo-Andrew Elliot-Jordi Sargatal - Lynx Edicions - ISBN: 8487334105\nA Complete Guide to Antarctic  Wildlife by Hadoram Shirihai and Illustrated  by Brett Jarrett - Edited by Guy M.

They are very similar in behaviour, and may appear fairly similar  in plumage in spite of different colours and pattern. \n    This raptor is often seen on exposed perch  on the roadside. It feeds both on carrion and live preys, and it is known for  its spectacular “sky-dancing displays”. This species is commonly seen gliding  above its habitat throughout New Zealand, but it is native, not an endemic bird  species. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics:\n    Length:  50-60 cm\n    Wingspan:  118-145 cm\n    Weight:  M: 650 g – F: 850 g\nThe adult  male has mainly dark brown upperparts with conspicuous white rump, well visible  in flight. Wings and tail are dark brown with darker bars on flight feathers  and rectrices.\n    On the  underparts, the breast is creamy-white with brown streaks. Rest of underparts,  including belly, vent and undertail-coverts are whitish. The underwing is creamy-white  too with streaked coverts and barred brown flight feathers with dark tips. \nOn the  brown head, we can see conspicuous facial disks giving this bird an owl-like  face mask. \n    The strongly  hooked bill is black with yellow cere. The eyes are yellow with pale yellow  eyering. Legs and feet are pale yellow.",

The black parts are  bordered with white, and there is a black speckling along the white borders by  underparts and undertail. \n    While the breeding plumage is  developing, the bird shows gradual variations of both colour and marking,  making them difficult to identify.

It is known as Banded Dotterel in New  Zealand and the Maori’s name is Tutuwhatu. \n    The population  is currently declining, due to introduced mammalian predators which take both  eggs and chicks in the nest on the ground. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD: \nBiometrics:\n    Length:  18-21 cm\n    Wingspan:  37-42 cm\n    Weight:  47-76 g – Race exilis: 78-89 g \nThe adult  in breeding plumage has rich grey-brown upperparts but the rump has white sides  and the outer rectrices are whitish. The flight feathers are blackish.   \n    The underparts  are white, but we can see a broad chestnut breast band and a narrower black  neck band. \nOn the  grey-brown head, there is a narrow, black, frontal bar above the white  forehead.

Short-legs and long, upcurved  bill make this bird very distinctive. Its foraging behaviour is more active  than the other Scolopacidae, as it  is frequently seen running about with the prey, in order to wash it before to  swallow it. \n    This species  is threatened by degradation and loss of the habitat, human pressure and  pollution, but the population is currently stable. \n    The first  individual was found in the Terek River on the NE edge of the Caucasus, giving  the bird its English name.   \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics:\n    Length:  22-25 cm\n    Wingspan:  57-59 cm\n    Weight:  50-126 g\nThe adult  in breeding plumage has grey-brown upperparts with narrow black streaks on  feathers, more conspicuous on scapulars where they form long, blackish lines. Rump,  uppertail-coverts and tail are usually paler grey than rest of upperparts. We can  see whitish tips to feathers in fresh plumage.\n    On the  upperwing, the coverts vary from grey-brown to blackish-brown, with broadly  tipped white secondaries, forming a conspicuous trailing edge. \nThe underparts  are white with grey wash on the breast, slightly darker and streaked with brown  on the sides, almost forming breast patches. The underwing is white with dark centres  to lesser coverts. \nOn the  head, the lores are dark, and we can see a narrow dark line behind the eye. \n    The long-upcurved  bill is blackish with dull orange area at base. The eyes are dark brown,  surrounded by white eyering. Legs and partially webbed feet are bright orange  to greenish-yellow. \n    The bill  may vary in size and curving among individuals, but the females have slightly  larger bill than males.",

    "Description": "Calidris fuscicolis\nCharadriiformes Order – Scolopacidae Family\nINTRODUCTION:\n    The White-rumped Sandpiper is a  long-distance migratory species, travelling from Canada’s arctic islands to the  southern tip of South America, and even farther to islands lying near the  Antarctic Peninsula. This migration is performed in stages of up to 4000  kilometres that can last up to 60 hours.\n    It nests on the arctic tundra,  usually near the coast. On migration and during winter, it frequents a variety  of both inland and coastal wetland habitats. It usually occurs in large flocks  on the wintering grounds. \n    The White-rumped Sandpiper is  threatened by degradation and habitat loss, and the population is suspected to  be decreasing. But currently, the species is not globally threatened.   \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length: 15-18 cm\n    Wingspan: 36-38 cm\n    Weight: 28-66 g\nThe White-rumped Sandpiper in  breeding plumage has pale chestnut-buff tinge on crown, ear-coverts and scapular  fringes. Shoulder and back feathers are mixed brown and grey. It has white  uppertail-coverts (not rump as mentioned in the name of the bird) contrasting  with the dark rump and tail. \n    On the white underparts, neck  sides, breast and flanks are pale with brown streaking and spotting. \n    The standing bird at rest shows  long primary tip projection beyond the tip of the tail. In flight, we can see a  white band on the uppertail. The male has inflatable throat used during the  displays.",

The adults often co-operate to defend chicks and nests  against predators. \n    The  species is threatened by introduced mice, cats and rats to some islands, but  most of the breeding areas are now predator-free islands.\n    Six  subspecies are currently recognized, but some of them are matter of some debate  and will become probably full species. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:  \nBiometrics: \n    Length:  35-40 cm\n    Wingspan:  75 cm \n    Weight:  150-180 g\nThe  adult has grey upperparts including the upperwing where the outer primaries  show variably grey to black outer webs. The rump and the deeply forked tail are  white. \n    The  underparts are greyish-white with white undertail-coverts. \nOn the  head, forehead, crown and nape are black, contrasting with the white cheeks.

    "Description": "anus\nCharadriiformes Order – Laridae Family\nINTRODUCTION: \n    The Kelp  Gull is present through much of the Southern Hemisphere. According to the  authors, 4 or 5 subspecies are recognized, but Kelp Gull’s taxonomy is still in  a state of uncertainty. As this species has extremely wide range, more  subspecies might be added in the future. However, you will find on this page numerous  pictures from several locations in the Southern Hemisphere.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics:  \n    Length:  54-65 cm\n    Wingspan:  128-143 cm\n    Weight:  900-1300 g\nThe adult  is a typical gull with black upperparts and white tail. On the black upperwing,  the trailing edge is white and the  wing tip shows white patches. \n    Head,  neck, nape, tail and underparts are white.\n  The bill  is yellow with red gonydal angle. The  eyes are yellow, surrounded by red or orange eyering. Legs and webbed feet are  greenish-yellow (mostly greyer in Africa).",

This  species lays the eggs in the nests of the Mohouidae,  and these tiny birds raise the young cuckoos.\n    The  Long-tailed Cuckoo is a long-distance migrant. It breeds in New Zealand, but  after the breeding season, it performs a remarkable overwater migration to  winter in a vast arc of Pacific islands. It migrates at night while uttering  loud shrill notes, giving the bird the name of “screamer”.  \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics: \n    Length:  38-42 cm\n    Weight:  120-125 g\nThe  adult male has rufous-barred brown upperparts, including the wings and the long  tail, as long as its body.\n    The  underparts are white to rufous and streaked black from chin to vent. The  streaks are usually thick. \nThe head  is blackish streaked rufous. There is a conspicuous white supercilium, and we  can see a dark moustachial stripe contrasting with the white lower cheek. \n    The bill  is yellow to horn-coloured. The eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are greyish. \nBoth  sexes are similar, but some birds can be more rufous and are often females. \n    The  juvenile has dark brown, heavily spotted creamy-white upperparts.

It often occurs in grasslands and  near water where it spends most time foraging among the vegetation, searching  for insects and larvae. \n    The Zitting  Cisticola is known for its aerial displays accompanied by regular “dziip”  calls. \nDESCRIPTION OF THE BIRD:\nBiometrics:\n    Length: 10  cm\n    Weight:  M: 7-12 g – F: 5-8 g\nThe adult  has buffy or rufous-brown upperparts with dark streaks on crown, mantle, back  and uppertail-coverts, and almost plain rump. The upperparts become duller and  darker in worn plumage. \n    Flight feathers  and tail are dark brown. We can see buff margins on flight-feathers and  upperwing-coverts, whereas the tail is edged rufous-brown with blackish subterminal  band and white tips (in fresh plumage). \n    The underparts  are creamy-buff with paler throat and central belly. Flanks and vent are  cinnamon-buff.",
