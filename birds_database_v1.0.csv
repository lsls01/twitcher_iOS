This is the second largest living bird, after the Ostrich.","The Emu  is found in Australia, but apart from desert areas and some south-western regions.  This species has been introduced to Kangaroo Island and Maria Island, off S  Australia.","The  breeding season starts in December-January with egg-laying in April-May.     The  reproduction of the Emu is based on successive polyandry of the females, while  their mates perform all the nesting duties.     After  pairing in December-January, the male builds the nest, a shallow depression on  the ground made with twigs, leaves and grass, in the shelter of some vegetation  but with a good view of the surrounding area.","The Emu  is omnivorous, but it feeds regularly on highly nutritious food. It feeds on  seeds, fruits, flowers and tender roots. In summer, large quantities of insects  are eaten, especially caterpillars, grasshoppers and beetles. It also takes small  vertebrates.     Coprophagy  is also recorded in order to avoid deshydratation in dry areas where food  resources are scarce. In suitable habitat, it drinks 2-3 times a day.","The Emu  has stable populations. This species has benefited from human alterations to  the environment, such as water supplies and fences which protect them from  predators.     The Emu  is not currently threatened.",190,150
